Significant resources have been invested toward cultivating an ecosystem for Urban Air Mobility that includes manufacturers of electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, builders of takeoff and landing areas, and researchers of the airspace integration concepts, technologies, and procedures needed to conduct Urban Air Mobility operations safely and efficiently alongside other airspace users. This paper provides high-level descriptions of both emergent and early expanded operational concepts for Urban Air Mobility that NASA is developing. The scope of this work is defined in terms of missions, aircraft, airspace, and hazards. Past and current Urban Air Mobility operations are also reviewed, and the considerations for the data exchange architecture and communication, navigation, and surveillance requirements are also discussed. This paper will serve as a starting point to develop a framework for NASAs Urban Air Mobility airspace integration research and development efforts with partners and stakeholders that could include fast-time simulations, human-in-the-loop simulations, and flight demonstrations. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2018-1266;2018;P.+Ventura S.+Yoon;High-Fidelity Computational Aerodynamics Of Multi-Rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles;High-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been carried out for several multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Three vehicles have been studied: the classic quadcopter DJI Phantom 3, an unconventional quadcopter specialized for forward flight, the SUI Endurance, and an innovative concept for Urban Air Mobility (UAM), the Elytron 4S UAV. The three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved on overset grids using high-order accurate schemes, dual-time stepping, and a hybrid turbulence model. The DJI Phantom 3 is simulated with different rotors and with both a simplified airframe and the real airframe including landing gear and a camera. The effects of weather are studied for the DJI Phantom 3 quadcopter in hover. The SUI Endurance original design is compared in forward flight to a new configuration conceived by the authors, the hybrid configuration, which gives a large improvement in forward thrust. The Elytron 4S UAV is simulated in helicopter mode and in airplane mode. Understanding the complex flows in multi-rotor vehicles will help design quieter, safer, and more efficient future drones and UAM vehicles. 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

However, questions regarding regulations, infrastructure requirements, and economic constraints remain to be answered. Therefore, this review aims at giving an overview on different research areas in the emerging topic of UAM. To this end, findings from several fields within the UAM research community were gathered and are presented here to provide a landscape of relevant questions surrounding the implementation of UAM. This overview considers vehicle-related aspects, such as aircraft requirements and aircraft classification for intra- and inter-city passenger transport, and discusses potential hurdles to their introduction. The exploration of challenges includes questions on certification and policy, as well as challenges in the area of traffic management and ground infrastructure requirements. Besides that, literature on operational concepts, possible market structures and the interaction with existing transport systems will be reviewed. The discussion of hurdles will conclude with a summary of current literature on public acceptance of UAM. An overview of methods for modelling and simulation of UAM will wrap up the prior discussion and provide insights on first modelling results. 2020 Elsevier Ltd;70
10.1016/j.tra.2019.12.020;2020;C.+Al E.+Chaniotakis A.+Straubinger K.+Pltner C.+Antoniou;Factors Affecting The Adoption And Use Of Urban Air Mobility;Technological advances have recently led to the development of urban air mobility (UAM), an alternative transportation mode with several concepts including vehicles operated by on-demand fully-automated vertical take-off and landing aircraft (VTOL) for intra-city passenger transportation. However, despite a growing interest in UAM, understanding users perceptions to it remains limited. This research aims to identify and quantify the factors affecting the adoption and use of UAM, based on relevant tools from the literature, such as recurring factors in studies on aerial vehicle concepts, ground autonomous vehicles, but also acceptance models, such as the Technology Acceptance Model by Davis et al. (1989). A stated-preference survey was developed to assess the perception of users in terms of adoption time horizon, including options such as the first six years of the service's implementation, unsure, and never. The obtained results were evaluated using exploratory factor analyses, and the specification and estimation of suitable discrete choice models, multinomial logit models (MNLs) and ordered logit models (OLMs), with adoption time horizon as dependent variable. Findings revealed the importance of safety and trust, affinity to automation, data concerns, social attitude, and socio-demographics for adoption. Factors, such as the value of time savings, the perception of automation costs, and service reliability, were also found to be highly influential. There was also an indication that skeptical respondents, i.e. answering unsure, had a behavior similar to late and non-adopters, i.e. adoption time horizon higher than six years or answering never. The summarized results were represented in an extended Technology Acceptance Model for urban air mobility, and provided insights for policymakers and industrial stakeholders. 2019 Elsevier Ltd;69
10.1177/0361198119843858;2019;M.+Fu R.+Rothfeld C.+Antoniou;Exploring Preferences For Transportation Modes In An Urban Air Mobility Environment: Munich Case Study;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a recent mobility concept with the potential to reduce travel time and change travel patterns. When evaluating the introduction of UAM, understanding the potential users choice behavior regarding current available urban transportation modes and autonomous transportation services is essential to demand estimation. This preliminary research intends to gain insight into the travel behavior impacts of autonomous transportation modes, especially UAM, by deriving measures for transportation service attributes and identifying characteristics of potential users who might adopt autonomous transportation services, particularly the services of UAM. Thus, a stated preference questionnaire was designed and distributed in Munich metropolitan region. A main mode choice multinomial logit model and several sub-models, based on market segmentation, were estimated regarding four transportation alternatives: private car, public transportation, autonomous taxi, and autonomous flying taxi. The results indicate that travel time, travel cost, and safety may be critical determinants in autonomous transportation mode adoption. The potential consumers may be willing to pay more for using autonomous transportation modes, especially the service of UAM. Among different market segments, younger individuals, as well as older individuals with high household income, are more likely to adopt UAM. In addition, during the market entry stage, potential travelers may favor UAM particularly for performing non-commuting trips. National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.;66

Drone industries have a significant potential for economical growth according to the latest estimations. To enable this growth safely and efficiently, the CORUS project has developed a concept of operations for drones flying in Europe in very low-level airspace, which they have to share that space with manned aviation, and quite soon with urban air mobility aircraft as well. U-space services and the development of smart, automated, interoperable, and sustainable traffic management solutions are presented as the key enabler for achieving this high level of integration. In this paper, we present the U-space concept of operations (ConOps), produced around three new types of airspace volume, called X, Y, and Z, and the relevant U-space services that will need to be supplied in each of these. The paper also describes the reference high-level U-space architecture using the European air traffic management architecture methodology. Finally, the paper proposes the basis for the aircraft separation standards applicable by each volume, to be used by the conflict detection and resolution services of U-space. 2019 by the authors.;55
10.2514/6.2018-3365;2018;C.+S.+Bosson T.+A.+Lauderdale;Simulation Evaluations Of An Autonomous Urban Air Mobility Network Management And Separation Service;This paper presents an initial implementation of an autonomous Urban Air Mobility network management and aircraft separation service for urban airspace that does 1) departure and arrival scheduling across the network, 2) continuous trajectory management to ensure safe separation between aircraft, and 3) seamless integration with traditional operations. The highly-autonomous AutoResolver algorithm developed for traditional aviation was extended to provide these capabilities. An evaluation of this initial implementation was conducted in fast-time simulations using a dense, two-hour traffic scenario with Urban Air Mobility aircraft flying between a network of 20 vertiports in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. When the spatial separation was reduced from 0.3nmi to 0.1nmi, the total delay decreased by 7.3%, when the temporal separation was reduced from 60s to 45s, the total delay decreased by 28.4%. The total number of conflict resolutions decreased by 26% and 17%, respectively. Furthermore, when a scheduling horizon greater than the duration of UAM flights was used (50min), most conflicts were resolved pre-departure producing ground delay. By comparison, when a shorter scheduling horizon was used (8min), most conflicts were resolved post-departure generating airborne delay. For all scheduling and separation constraints tested, AutoResolver prevented loss of separation from occurring. Urban Air Mobility operations have the ability to revolutionize how people and goods are transported and this paper presents initial research focusing on the high levels of autonomy required for an airspace system capable of scaling to handle significantly higher densities of aircraft. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2018;M.+D.+Patterson K.+R.+Antcliff L.+W.+Kohlman;A Proposed Approach To Studying Urban Air Mobility Missions Including An Initial Exploration Of Mission Requirements;Urban air mobility (UAM) is an emerging aviation market that seeks to revolutionize mobility around metropolitan areas via a safe, efficient, and accessible on-demand air transportation system for passengers and cargo. In this paper we describe our three-pronged approach to studying passenger-carrying UAM missions, and we detail the first phase of this approach, which consists of defining an initial set of requirements for multiple exemplar UAM missions. The development of these mission requirements provides justifiable assumptions that feed the second phase of the approach, which is performing aircraft conceptual design studies. Vehicle design is not included in this paper, but the work described here will define sizing missions for follow-on design and sizing studies. The aircraft that emerge from the design studies can then feed the third phase of our UAM analysis approach, which involves simulating an entire UAM network over a metropolitan area to study transportation-system level characteristics. Iteration between each of the three phases of the UAM analysis approach will be necessary to propagate lessons learned as our research progresses and as the UAM community coalesces on a more unified vision for UAM. Therefore, we anticipate that the mission requirements set forth in this paper will be modified over time as the urban air mobility concept matures. Copyright 2017 by AHS International, Inc.

10.2514/6.2018-3849;2018;P.+D.+Vascik R.+J.+Hansman;Scaling Constraints For Urban Air Mobility Operations: Air Traffic Control, Ground Infrastructure, And Noise;The scalability of the current air traffic control system, the availability of aviation ground infrastructure, and the acceptability of aircraft noise to local communities have been identified as three key operational constraints that may limit the implementation or growth of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. This paper identifies the primary mechanisms through which each constraint emerges to limit the number of UAM operations in an area (i.e. the scale of the service). Technical, ecosystem, or operational factors that influence each of the mechanisms are also identified. Interdependencies between the constraints are shown. Potential approaches to reduce constraint severity through adjustments to the mechanisms are introduced. Finally, an effort is made to characterize the severity of each operational constraint as a function of the density of UAM operations in a region of interest. To this end, a measure of severity is proposed for each constraint. This measure is used to notionally display how the severity of the constraint responds to UAM scaling, and to identify scenarios where efforts to relieve the constraint are most effective. The overall purpose of this paper is to provide an abstraction of the workings of the key UAM operational constraints so that researchers, developers, and practitioners may guide their efforts to mitigation pathways that are most likely to increase achievable UAM system scale. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-0526;2019;P.+D.+Vascik R.+J.+Hansman;Development Of Vertiport Capacity Envelopes And Analysis Of Their Sensitivity To Topological And Operational Factors;This study develops an Integer Programming (IP) approach to analytically estimate vertiport capacity envelopes. The approach is used to determine the sensitivity of vertiport capacity to the number and layout of touchdown and liftoff pads, taxiways, gates, and parking pads (i.e. the vertiport topology). The study also assesses the sensitivity of vertiport capacity to operational parameters including taxi time, turnaround time, pre-staged aircraft, and approach/departure procedure independence, among others. Findings indicate the importance of balancing the number of touchdown and liftoff pads with the number of gates to achieve maximum aircraft throughput per vertiport footprint. Furthermore, simultaneous paired arrivals or departures provide significant throughput gains without the need for fully independent approach and departure procedures. The methodology and findings introduced in this paper support the development of concepts of operation to maximize throughput for a given vertiport footprint and demand scenario. While throughput has been extensively researched for fixed-wing operations, little research has been dedicated to the operation of infrastructure for Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. The emergence of new VTOL aircraft to conduct a potentially large number of urban air mobility operations creates a need to better understand the operation and throughput capacity of vertiports, especially in space constrained inner-city locations. This paper reviews numerous existing heliport designs to derive four topology classes of vertiport layouts. The IP formulation of vertiport operations is readily adapted to represent the infrastructure and operations of these layouts. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/1.D0120;2018;P.+D.+Vascik R.+John N.+S.+Dunn;Analysis Of Urban Air Mobility Operational Constraints;Urban air mobility (UAM) refers to a set of vehicles and operational concepts proposed to provide on-demand or scheduled air transportation services within a metropolitan area. This paper investigates potential operational constraints that could arise during the implementation or scale-up of a UAM system. Literature on helicopter passenger networks was reviewed to determine operational constraints experienced by prior services similar toUAM. A constraint analysis was applied to near-term UAM operations in Los Angeles, Boston, and Dallas to assess if the historical constraints persist, or if novel constraints have emerged. The three city cases represented geographically diverse implementation regions for UAM services. A notional door-to-door concept of operations was applied to 32 reference missions within the three city cases. The reference missions exhibited a variety of requirements in terms of flight distance, passenger volume, market type, population overflight, and air traffic congestion, among others. By reviewing ground and flight operations for each reference mission, eight operational constraints were identified that could limit UAM system growth potential or prohibit UAM services altogether. The three most stringent constraints concerned community acceptance of aircraft noise, takeoff and landing area availability, and air traffic control scalability. 2018 by Parker Vascik.;44
10.1109/DASC.2018.8569645;2018;I.+C.+Kleinbekman M.+A.+Mitici P.+Wei;Evtol Arrival Sequencing And Scheduling For On-Demand Urban Air Mobility;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has the ability to reduce ground traffic congestion by enabling rapid on-demand flight through three-dimensional airspace with zero operational emissions by using electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles. In the long term with more UAM flights, air traffic control is expected to limit further growth of such operations. Therefore, a first research has been performed on energy-efficient trajectory optimisation for a given required time of arrival, as the arrival phase is the most safety-critical flight phase with much higher air traffic density and limited battery energy. However, research on the computation of the optimal required time of arrival (RTA) for eVTOL aircraft has not yet been performed. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters in commercial aviation, eVTOL aircraft have different flight dynamics, limited battery energy supply and a limited number of landing spots at a vertiport such as the top of high-rise buildings. This work is the first to utilise a mixed-integer linear program that computes the optimal RTAs for eVTOLs to safely separate them for minimum delay based on remaining battery state of charge and vertiport capacity. A concept of operations for vertiport terminal area airspace design is also proposed while making use of the existing energy-efficient trajectory optimisation tool. The research serves as a basis for further development of safe and efficient UAM operations. The mathematical model can also be applied to Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) by inserting new separation requirements and flight dynamics for smaller drones when optimising a high density arrival terminal airspace. 2018 IEEE.;41

An early methodology of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) extension for the multi-agent transport simulation, MATSim, is being presented, which enables first analyses of system-wide urban transport performance considering the effects of variations in VTOL vehicle properties and dedicated VTOL infrastructure placement. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

An existing agent-based transport model of the study area were used and extended to cover socio-demographic changes up to the year 2030 and intermodal UAM services. An incremental logit model for UAM was derived to simulate demand for this new mode. An airport access model was developed as well. Three different UAM networks with different numbers of vertiports were defined. Sensitivity studies of ticket fare and structure, flying vehicle cruise speed, passenger process times at vertiports and different Urban Air Mobility networks sizes were performed. For the reference case, UAM accounts for a modal share of 0.5%. The absolute UAM demand is concentrated on very short routes, hence, UAM vehicle flight speed variation shows low UAM demand impacts. Kilometer-based fare, number of UAM vehicles per vertiport and passenger process times at vertiports show a significant impact on UAM demand. 2020, Deutsches Zentrum fr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.;37

Moving to electric aircraft brings undeniable benefits in terms of environmental impact, cost savings, maintenance, noise pollution, and safety. Nevertheless, several technical challenges are yet to be overcome to build electric airplanes that meet public needs while gaining acceptance and trust. From urban air mobility to long-haul flight applications, hundreds of projects are under research to push toward more electrification. At the heart of each aircraft architecture, power electronics plays a crucial role in the new era of transportation. This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art power electronics in electric aircraft. A review of the current status of aircraft electrification will be provided, and technology surveys of power electronic converters will be detailed. Challenges for forthcoming power electronics in response to the future trends of the electrical network will be explained. Finally, emerging technologies regarding wide bandgap devices, advanced topologies and control, thermal management, passive components, and system integration will be discussed. 2015 IEEE.;37
10.2514/6.2018-3677;2018;L.+W.+Kohlman M.+D.+Patterson;System-Level Urban Air Mobility Transportation Modeling And Determination Of Energy-Related Constraints;In this paper, we describe a transportation system-level model of an urban air mobility (UAM) network over a single metropolitan area. This model provides the ability to assess many parameters, including the number of vehicles needed in the system to meet demand, the number of vehicles airborne at any given time, and the length of time vehicles may have to loiter before a landing pad becomes available. We focus our initial studies with the model on exploring the UAM system-level implications of different energy storage systems on UAM vehicles. Specifically, we compare fully-battery-electric vehicles to vehicles with multiple hybrid-electric powertrains, which consist of different energy conversion systems (i.e., engines and fuel cells) and fuels. The transportation system-level model provides insight into vertiport ground infrastructure requirements, such as the number of recharging or refueling stations and the impact of various vehicle powertrains on these requirements. Ultimately, results indicate that the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel in a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell-battery-turbine system can result in a vehicle power system that provides lower operating costs, reduced carbon dioxide emissions, and lower power system weights than pure batteryelectric solutions at the same power level while also having fewer infrastructure integration issues. Additionally, a hybrid internal combustion engine-generator-battery solution fueled with LNG provides a near-equivalent energy cost solution to pure battery-electric power systems at the same power level, but at a much lower system mass. Consequently, this hybrid architecture is expected to provide advantages for sized vehicles over other power system types. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.1016/j.paerosci.2021.100726;2021;A.+Bauranov J.+Rakas;Designing Airspace For Urban Air Mobility: A Review Of Concepts And Approaches;The article brings together the academic and industry literature on the design and management of urban airspace. We analyze the proposed airspace concepts, identify their strengths and weaknesses, point to gaps in research, and provide recommendations for a more holistic approach to designing urban airspace. We first identify the structural factors that define the size, capacity, and geometry of urban airspace. These factors are grouped into four categories: safety-related factors, social factors, system factors, and aircraft factors. Second, we review different urban airspace concepts proposed around the world. Third, we assess the airspace concepts based on the identified factors. Most of the reviewed airspace concepts are idealized as abstract networks, with an emphasis on maximizing safety and capacity, and with little regard for factors such as technological complexity, noise, or privacy. Additionally, we find that the airspace structure directly influences the level of safety, efficiency, and capacity of airspace. On the one hand, air vehicles in less structured airspace have more degrees of freedom. They can freely choose their position, altitude, heading, and speed, which increases airspace capacity and reduces flying costs. However, these concepts require high technological capabilities, such as dynamic geofences and advanced sense-and-avoid capabilities, to maintain the required safety levels. On the other hand, airspace concepts with fewer degrees of freedom can accommodate less capable aircraft but require strict operation rules and reduced capacity to ensure safety. Finally, the proposed urban air mobility concepts require extensive ground infrastructures, such as take-off and landing pads and communication, navigation, and surveillance infrastructure. There is a need for a new branch of research that analyzes urban air mobility from the perspective of urban planning, including issues around zoning, air rights, public transportation, real estate development, public acceptance, and access inequalities. 2021 The Authors;35
N/A;2020;C.+Malpica S.+Withrow-Maser;Handling Qualities Analysis Of Blade Pitch And Rotor Speed Controlled Evtol Quadrotor Concepts For Urban Air Mobility;A study of the handling qualities of quadrotor designs for urban air mobility (UAM) application was performed. Eight different quadrotor configurations based on NASA reference concept vehicles were considered for investigation. The study was based on NASA single-passenger (250-lb payload) 50-nm range and six-passenger (1,200-lb payload) reference quadrotor designs. Intermediate-sized two- and four-passenger (400- and 800-lb payload) designs formed the final candidate configurations. All aircraft were equipped with electric motors for propulsion, but different variants were configured with variable pitch (collective) control (with constant rotor speed) or variable rotor speed control (with constant pitch). Flight dynamics models developed had sufficient richness of detail to conduct flight control or handling qualities assessments. Based on the various modeling assumptions, assessments showed that collective control was feasible, whereas rotor speed-based control exhibited unstable closed-loop roll and pitch dynamics. Vehicle size in the range considered did not cause significant change in the handling qualities because of a fundamental trade-off between the underlying parameters that govern the control power-to-weight (inertia) ratio.

10.2514/1.G005000;2020;X.+Yang P.+Wei;Scalable Multi-Agent Computational Guidance With Separation Assurance For Autonomous Urban Air Mobility;Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are becoming promising for on-demand air transportation in urban air mobility (UAM). However, successfully bringing such vehicles and airspace operations to fruition will require introducing orders of magnitude more aircraft to a given airspace volume. Although there are existing solutions for communication technology, onboard computing capability, and sensor technology, the computation guidance algorithm to enable safe, efficient, and scalable flight operations for dense self-organizing air traffic still remains an open question. In this paper, a message-based decentralized computational guidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed for multiple cooperative aircraft by formulating this problem using multi-agent Markov decision process and solving it by Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. A novel coordination strategy is introduced by using the logit level-k model in behavioral game theory. To achieve higher scalability, the airspace sector concept is introduced into the UAM environment by dividing the airspace into sectors, so that each aircraft only needs to coordinate with aircraft in the same sector. At each decision step, all of the aircraft will run the proposed computational guidance algorithm onboard, which can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts among them. For validation and demonstration, a free-flight airspace simulator that incorporates environment uncertainty is built in an OpenAI Gym environment. Numerical experiment results over several case studies, including the roundabout test problem, show that the proposed computational guidance algorithm has promising performance even with the high-density air traffic case. 2020 by Xuxi Yang and Peng Wei.;33
10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.032;2018;I.+Gerdes A.+Temme M.+Schultz;Dynamic Airspace Sectorisation For Flight-Centric Operations;Today's air traffic operations follow the paradigm of flow follows structure which already limits the operational efficiency and punctuality of current air traffic movements. Therefore, we introduce the dynamic airspace sectorisation and consequently change this paradigm to the more appropriate approach of structure follows flow. The dynamic airspace sectorisation allows an efficient allocation of scarce resources considering operational, economic and ecological constraints in both nominal and variable air traffic conditions. Our approach clusters traffic patterns and uses evolutionary algorithms for optimisation of the airspace, focusing on high capacity utilisation through flexible use of airspace, appropriate distribution of task load for air traffic controllers and fast adaptation to changed operational constraints. We thereby offer a solution for handling non-convex airspace boundaries and provide a proof of concept using current operational airspace structures and enabling a flight-centric air traffic management. We are confident that our developed dynamic airspace sectorisation significantly contributes to the challenges of future airspace by providing appropriate structures for future 4D aircraft trajectories taking into account various operational aspects of air traffic such as temporally restricted areas, limited capacities, zones of convective weather or urban air mobility. Dynamic sectorisation is a key enabling technology in the achievement of the ambitious goals of Single European Sky and Flightpath 2050 through a reduction in coordination efforts, efficient resource allocation, reduced aircraft emissions, fewer detours, and minimisation of air traffic delays. 2018 Elsevier Ltd;31
10.1109/TITS.2021.3082767;2021;A.+P.+Cohen S.+A.+Shaheen E.+M.+Farrar;Urban Air Mobility: History, Ecosystem, Market Potential, And Challenges;Since the early 20th century, inventors have conceptualized 'plane cars' and other urban aerial transportation. Emerging innovations in electrification, automation, and other technologies are enabling new opportunities for on-demand air mobility, business models, and aircraft design. Urban air mobility (UAM) envisions a safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation system for passenger mobility, goods delivery, and emergency services within or traversing metropolitan areas. This research employed a multi-method approach comprised of 106 interviews with thought leaders and two stakeholder workshops to construct the history, ecosystem, state of the industry, and potential evolution of UAM. The history, current developments, and anticipated milestones of UAM can be classified into six phases: 1) 'flying car' concepts from the early 1910s to 1950s, 2) early UAM operations using scheduled helicopter services from the 1950s to 1980s, 3) re-emergence of on-demand services starting in the 2010s, 4) corridor services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) envisioned for the 2020s, 5) hub and spoke services, and 6) point-to-point services. In the future, UAM could face several barriers to growth and mainstreaming, such as the existing regulatory environment, community acceptance, and concerns about safety, noise, social equity, and environmental impacts. UAM also could be limited by infrastructure and airspace management needs, as well as business model constraints. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research on sustainability, social and economic impacts, airspace integration, and other topics. 2000-2011 IEEE.;29

Findings on the sharing economy suggest that accommodation sharing increases long-distance travel, bikesharing is conducive to more active travel and lower car use, carsharing may reduce private car use and ownership, ridesourcing (ridehailing) may increase vehicle miles traveled, while the implications of e-scooter sharing, ridesharing, and Mobility as a Service are context-dependent. Findings on emerging transportation technologies suggest that private autonomous vehicles and urban air mobility may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use. Implications of App Cities for the built environment include new transport systems and land use changes due to behavioral changes. 2021 The Author(s);29
10.2514/1.I010710;2019;P.+Pradeep P.+Wei;Energy-Efficient Arrival With Rta Constraint For Multirotor Evtol In Urban Air Mobility;The electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft can alleviate transportation congestion on the ground by using three-dimensional airspace efficiently. However, the endurance of lithium-ion polymer (Li-Po) batteries imposes critical constraints on the operational time span of an eVTOL aircraft on urban air mobility (UAM) passenger transportation mission. This research focuses on the formulation of fixed-final-time multiphase optimal control problem with energy consumption as the performance index for a multirotor eVTOL aircraft. The proposed multiphase optimal control problem formulation and the numerical solution enables a multirotor eVTOL aircraft to meet the assigned required time of arrival and achieve an energy-efficient arrival trajectory for a given concept of operation (CONOP), which is a critical enabler for the safe and efficient future eVTOL operations for passenger transportation and cargo delivery. The problem formulation is applied to a UAM passenger transportation use case with EHang 184 eVTOL aircraft, and an Uber-proposed vertiport for five different types of CONOPs. Finally, the energy consumed for all the CONOPs is compared to propose the most energy-efficient CONOP for a multirotor eVTOL on UAM passenger transportation mission. The proposed framework can also be used to address an energy-efficient cargo delivery application in a UAS traffic management context.

In this work, we use simplified models for the aerodynamics, propulsion, propeller-wing flow interaction, and flight mechanics to carry out gradient-based optimization studies for the takeoff-to-cruise trajectory of a tandem tilt-wing eVTOL aircraft. We present results for optimizations with and without stall and acceleration constraints, with varying levels of flow augmentation from propellers, and find that the optimal takeoffs involve stalling the wings or flying near the stall angle of attack. However, we find that the energy penalty for avoiding stall is practically negligible. Additionally, we find that without acceleration constraints, the optimized trajectories involve rapidly transitioning to forward flight and accelerating, followed by climbing at roughly constant speed, and then accelerating to the required cruise speed. With an acceleration constraint for passenger comfort, the transition, climb, and acceleration phases are more gradual and less distinct. We also present results showing the impact of wing loading and available power on the optimized trajectories. 2020 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.;28

One such concept is the stacked rotor, which consists of multiple co-rotating rotors positioned co-axially with a small axial offset. The goal of the work presented in this paper is to determine whether stacked rotors offer a compelling advantage for eVTOL aircraft in terms of both performance and acoustic characteristics. Results are presented for new experimental tests and computational modeling of multiple stacked rotor configurations, and comparisons are made with conventional rotor configurations. Testing of thirteen separate configurations each using the same blade shaperevealed a configuration that resulted in an increase in the rotor power loading efficiency by approximately 7%, with an associated out-of-plane noise reduction up to approximately 3 dBA, when compared with a conventional rotor with all blades located in the same rotational plane for a common thrust condition. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-2827;2019;E.+J.+Alvarez A.+Ning;Modeling Multirotor Aerodynamic Interactions Through The Vortex Particle Method;Distributed electric propulsion and vertical take-off and landing has recently opened a new design space for urban air mobility. However, the use of multiple rotors operating in close proximity introduces complicated aerodynamic interactions that are not well understood, are not captured through conventional design tools, and need to be addressed in the conceptual design stage. This study investigates the accuracy of the viscous vortex particle method (VPM) in modeling rotor-on-rotor aerodynamic interactions in a side-by-side configuration as encountered in tilt-rotor, quadrotor, and distributed propulsion aircraft. The VPM approach has the potential to enable the use of mid/high fidelity models capturing multirotor interactions during conceptual design. Validation of the individual rotor is presented in both hovering and forward-flight configurations at both low and high Reynolds numbers. Validation of the hovering multirotor is then presented, followed by a detailed parametric study of rotor-to-rotor interactions during hover and forward flight, constructing the response surface of thrust, torque, and propulsive efficiency as a function of operational parameters. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The particular case study we examine involves delivering small packages from a warehouse located in Tracy, CA to vertiport hubs in the San Franciso Bay Area. The package transit is envisioned to occur via two legs: an eVTOL trip from the warehouse to a vertiport located near the consumer, followed by last-mile delivery by car, small UAS, or other mode from the vertiport to the consumer. First, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to select cargo vertiport locations by maximizing the package demand served, subject to limits on the number of vertiports. Next, we examine the sizing, mission performance, recharge time requirements, and daily package throughput of two representative classes of eVTOL vehicles for this case study example. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

One of the concepts currently being studied and developed are eVTOL (electrical vertical takeoff and landing) vehicles. This paper discusses a nonlinear dynamic inversion based control law that was designed for this vehicle concept. Two advantageous inherent properties of dynamic inversion in this setup are the effective decoupling of the control axes which are by design highly coupled for this kind of vehicle, and its ability to naturally handle changes of operating condition, which removes the need for gain scheduling. These are advantageous for control of VTOL vehicles, due to their wide range of operating conditions which varies from hover to forward flight, and transitioning between them. The inner dynamic inversion control loop, including an optimization based blended control allocation strategy to the rotors as well as to the control surfaces, serves as an inner core flight control system for the full envelope. This setup is complemented with a set of linear controllers, and reference models as well as command filtering for the different manual control modes in the various flight phases. An autoflight mode is included as well. By using Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion, it was found that the overall controller becomes significantly less dependent on accurate aircraft model properties, especially with respect to the aerodynamic derivatives, of which one can expect limited knowledge for this kind of UAM vehicles. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.3390/s19194209;2019;S.+Bijjahalli R.+Sabatini A.+Gardi;Gnss Performance Modelling And Augmentation For Urban Air Mobility;One of the primary challenges facing Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and the safe integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the urban airspace is the availability of robust, reliable navigation and Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) systems. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are typically the primary source of positioning for most air and ground vehicles and for a growing number of UAS applications, however, their performance is frequently inadequate in such challenging environments. This paper performs a comprehensive analysis of GNSS performance for UAS operations with a focus on failure modes in urban environments. Based on the analysis, a guidance strategy is developed which accounts for the influence of urban structures on GNSS performance. A simulation case study representative of UAS operations in urban environments is conducted to assess the validity of the proposed approach. Results show improved accuracy (approximately 25%) and availability when compared against a conventional minimum-distance guidance strategy. 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;25

One of the concepts currently being studied and developed are tiltrotor eVTOL (electrical vertical takeoff and landing) vehicles. One of the many challenges that these vehicles face is manual nonlinear flight control with a focus on minimum required pilot training.

10.2514/1.C035756;2020;A.+Brown W.+L.+Harris;Vehicle Design And Optimization Model For Urban Air Mobility;Urban air mobility refers to an envisaged air taxi service, using small, autonomous, vertical-takeoff-and-landing, battery-powered electric aircraft. A conceptual design and optimization tool for urban air mobility, including vehicle, mission, and cost models, is presented in this paper. The tool uses geometric programming, a class of optimization problems with extremely fast solve times and for which global optimality is guaranteed. The tool is used to conduct a study of urban air mobility from a vehicle design perspective. Vehicle configurations with a higher lift-to-drag ratio, but a higher disk loading, generally weigh less and cost less to operate. The battery and the pilot are identified as the two main cost drivers, strategies for reducing these two costs are discussed. A case study is conducted on New York City airport transfers, trip times and costs are compared with those of current helicopter air taxi operations and with car ride-sharing. Sensitivity analyses are presented with respect to reserve requirements, mission range, and battery energy density. A battery energy density of 400 Wh/kg is shown to be a critical enabling value for urban air mobility. 2020 by the authors.

Due to a novel design space enabled by distributed electric propulsion, fundamentally different vertical take-off and landing aircraft concepts are developed. To further concretize the vision of an urban air transportation system, it is important to know the characteristics of the various vehicle technologies and to understand the effects on an overall system. This technical paper evaluates two recent aircraft concepts: an 18-rotor multicopter and a configuration with separate propulsion systems for vertical take-off and landing and fixed-wing cruise flight (lift+cruise). Starting from a base configuration, several versions of the aircraft are derived to investigate sizing effects and trade-offs between VTOL and cruise efficiency. Mission performance calculations for a defined design mission and off-design missions are conducted. Finally, a demonstration scenario simulation is presented, which will allow future investigations regarding the transport performance of a vehicle within a complete urban air transportation system. 31st Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, ICAS 2018.

UAM is not the first disruptive technology in transportation, with recent examples including electric ground vehicles (EVs), autonomous ground vehicles (AVs), and sharing services. In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis of about 800 articles in the UAM, EV, and AV areas that have been published from January 2015 to June 2020, and compare and contrast research thrusts in order to inform future UAM research. Alongside this effort, we conduct an in-depth review of articles related to demand modeling, operations, and integration with existing infrastructure. We use insights from the meta-analysis and comprehensive review to inform future UAM research directions. Some of the potential research directions we identify include: (1) developing more refined demand models that incorporate the timing of when individuals will adopt UAM, (2) developing high-fidelity simulation models for UAM operations that capture interactions among vertiport locations, vertiport topology, demand, pricing, dispatching, and airspace restrictions, (3) explicitly considering one-way demand and parking constraints in demand and operational models, and (4) developing more realistic time-of-day energy profiles for UAM vehicles in order to assess whether the current electrical grid can support UAM operations. 2021 The Authors;21

Apart from technical challenges for eVTOLs regarding vehicle design and manufacturing, airspace design and traffic control mechanisms are most desired on the operation side. In particular, from an operational point of view, the arrival phase is expected to be the main bottleneck, with restricted vertiport resources, high air traffic density, frequent flight maneuvers, and limited eVTOL remaining battery energy, all leading to complex operational constraints. This work provides a framework to enable optimal and efficient on-demand eVTOLs arrivals in the context of on-demand urban air mobility. This paper investigates the throughput of a double-landing-pad vertiport by proposing a new vertiport terminal area airspace design and a novel rolling-horizon scheduling algorithm with route selection capability to compute the optimal required time of arrival for eVTOLs in a tactical manner. Finally, a case study on arrivals in a hexagonal vertiport network is performed to show the algorithm performance with different configurations. Our simulation results show that up to 50 s delay per eVTOL is expected during the commuter peak hours and less than 10 s delay is expected during off-peak hours. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

An overview is given of the system constraints and key enabling technologies that must be incorporated into the design of the vehicle. The tradeoffs between vehicle performance and runway length are investigated using geometric programming, a robust optimization framework. Runway lengths as short as 100-300 ft are shown to be feasible, depending on the level of technology and the desired cruise speed. The tradeoffs between runway length and the potential to build new infrastructure in urban centers are investigated using Boston as a representative case study. The placement of some runways up to 600ft is shown to be possible in the urban center, with a significant increase in the number of potential locations for runways shorter than 300ft.

Due to their flexible mobility patterns and automated operational characteristics, flying taxi and shared flying car services are expected to expand the existing shared mobility services (such as Uber, Lyft, and similar services) of the urban transportation network. Despite their forthcoming introduction in the shared mobility market, public perceptions and expectations about these services have not been investigated in travel demand literature. This study aims to provide an exploratory analysis of public willingness to hire and pay for flying taxis and shared flying car services, and to identify the determinants of the willingness to hire and pay for such services. Using data collected from an online survey, individuals' willingness to hire and to pay for flying taxi and shared flying car services are statistically modeled within a correlated grouped random parameters bivariate probit framework. The analysis shows that various socio-demographic characteristics and individuals opinions towards the perceived benefits and challenges of flying cars affect public willingness to hire and pay for flying taxi and shared flying car services. Even though the awareness about the operation of flying taxis and shared flying car services is possibly limited in the public sphere, the findings of this study can provide insights into the challenges that policymakers, manufacturing companies, and shared mobility providers will face with the introduction of such flying car services in the transportation networks. 2020 Elsevier Ltd;20

Many types of configurations are under consideration and a variety of approaches to eVTOL UAM have been brought to the prototyping stage in the past few years. In this paper, the relative merit of each main class of configuration is evaluated using a weights-based optimization process. Optimal configurations are chosen across a two-dimensional domain of mission range and speed, with additional considerations made for rotor size, wing loading, and battery energy density parameters. Individual design points are also analyzed as case studies for the optimization and design process for different types of aircraft flying various UAM missions. This determination of optimal configuration for each mission specification may be used to inform a thorough trade analysis of possible aircraft designs and subsequent feasibility studies of specific proposals, particularly near the boundaries at which optimality transitions between configurations. Using weights as an analogue for design viability, the analysis has the potential to form the basis of an essential framework to guide the development and engineering decisions for prospective aircraft entering the market in the near future. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

VTOL is not only a very suitable technology for UAVs due to the convenience and concealment mission requirements of UAVs, but also very important for both military and civil MAVs due to the advantages of less or even no dependency on airports/air fields. As such, it is necessary to study and compare the VTOL technology of MAVs and UAVs at the same time. This paper highlights the major VTOL technologies and the representing aircraft configurations. The recent VTOL projects in the US are reviewed and compared to give insight into the technological diversities, application opportunities as well as the future development trend for urban air mobility. Then, an intuitive summary and comparison of famous projects and models has been made. Based on the above research, challenges and constraints of VTOL aircraft are summarized.

Further, the risks associated with unmanned aircraft operations themselves have to be recognized and mitigated in a timely manner. Safety-critical risks include, but are not limited to, flight outside of approved airspace, unsafe proximity to people or property, critical system failures, loss-of-control, and cyber-security related risks. Instead of reacting to accidents, a set of predictive and data-driven risk monitoring, assessment, and mitigation capabilities are envisioned to help capture and eliminate hazards as these systems become operational. NASAs System-wide Safety project is performing R&D on such a safety assurance concept. As part of this concept, this paper describes an architecture that continuously monitors a diverse set of onboard and ground-based sources to estimate and predict non-participant casualty risk during flight. Timely identification of the changing nature of this risk can inform decision making processes to mitigate current and impending situations. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This report discusses the vehicle-level technology assumptions for NASAs UAM reference vehicles, and highlights future research areas for second-generation UAM aircraft that include deflected slipstream concepts, low-noise rotors for edgewise flight, stacked rotors/propellers, ducted propellers, solid oxide fuel cells with liquefied natural gas, and improved turboshaft and reciprocating engine technology. The report also highlights a transportation network-scale model that is being developed to understand the impact of these and other technologies on future UAM solutions. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-0818;2019;M.+Clarke J.+Smart E.+Botero W.+Maier J.+J.+Alonso;Strategies For Posing A Well-Defined Problem For Urban Air Mobility Vehicles;Over the past decade, the use of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban air mobility (UAM) has seen a dramatic rise in interest from both the private and public sectors. Motivated by a surge in commuter air travel, the industry is rapidly propos-ing and adopting new vehicle concepts to meet consumer demands. However, variability in mission profiles and strong interdependencies of vehicle components present several challenges when implementing traditional aircraft design methodologies. Due to the absence of a tried-and-true approach, eVTOL concepts have come in all imaginable sizes and configurations. This has led to the creation of high-dimensional and computationally expensive optimization problems. In this paper, potential design strategies are presented and compared, identifying design variables and constraints which take precedence during a particular optimization. A novel weight build-up approach to estimating operating empty weight is also introduced. The results of this study were then used to restructure the methodology employed in the preliminary stages of conceptual eVTOL design. This work precedes a larger study to quantify post-optimality sensitivities of constraints, which will allow for the removal of implicitly resolved parameters and a reduction in computational cost. 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

10.2514/6.2019-3519;2019;G.+Zhu P.+Wei;Pre-Depature Planning For Urban Air Mobility Flights With Dynamic Airspace Reservation;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is new air transportation concept where highly autonomous aircraft could safely and efficiently transport passengers and cargo within the city by rising above the traffic congestion on the ground. Conflict avoidance is a core research problem to enable UAM for high density operations. As the outer layer of protection, pre-departure planning can optimize trajectory under physical and operation constraints, coordinate flights with existing flight plans, alleviate the burden of inner layer sense and avoid, and increase the predictability of an operation. Dynamic geofence is a moving region of reserved airspace for an aircraft, which provides a safety buffer for various uncertainties including flight operation, localization and disturbances from weather. This paper is an endeavor to do pre-departure conflict-free trajectory planning for flight with dynamic geofence in structured airspace. We propose an efficient, scalable, two-phase, linear programming based algorithm. In the first phase of the algorithm, we discretize the flight into time periods and formulate an integer programming model, which is proved to be Totally Unimodular (TU), to avoid conflict with already filed flight plans and to determine the location of dynamic geofence in each time period. In the second phase, we propose a velocity profile smoothing model to make the trajectory easier to fly. This main advantage of this algorithm is its verifiable safety guarantee, which can be valuable to the UAM community. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.1016/j.ast.2021.107154;2021;W.+Dai B.+Pang K.+H.+Low;Conflict-Free Four-Dimensional Path Planning For Urban Air Mobility Considering Airspace Occupancy;Urban air mobility (UAM) has attracted the attention of aircraft manufacturers, air navigation service providers and governments in recent years. Preventing the conflict among urban aircraft is crucial to UAM traffic safety, which is a key in enabling large scale UAM operation. Pre-flight conflict-free path planning can provide a strategic layer in the maintenance of safety performance, thus becomes an important element in UAM. This paper aims at tackling conflict-free path planning problem for UAM operation with a consideration of four-dimensional airspace management. In the paper, we first introduce AirMatrix, previously developed by the team, and extend it as a four-dimensional airspace management concept. On the basis of AirMatrix, we formulate the shortest flight time path planning problem considering resolution of conflicts with both static and dynamic obstacles. A Conflict-Free A* (CFA*) algorithm is developed for planning four-dimensional paths based on first-come-first-served scheme. The algorithm contains a novel design of heuristic function as well as a conflict detection and resolution strategy. Numerical simulation was carried out using the building information in a typical urban area in Singapore. The results show that the algorithm can generate paths resolving a significant number of potential conflicts in airspace utilization, with acceptable computational time and flight delay. The findings of this study will provide references for stakeholders to support the development of UAM. 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS;16

This paper describes the methodology used for wind tunnel testing of the Langley Aerodrome No. 8 (LA-8) in the NASA Langley 12-Foot Low-Speed Tunnel during multiple test entries in 2019 and 2020. The LA-8 is a tandem tilt-wing aircraft with 4 motor-propeller units and 4 control surfaces distributed across each wing, plus an inverted V-tail with 2 ruddervators on the fuselage. An initial tunnel entry used one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) testing to (1) define candidate trimmed transition corridors between vertical and horizontal flight, (2) assess whether there was adequate control authority, and (3) define appropriate test factor ranges for subsequent design of experiment (DOE) wind tunnel testing. The total number of independent variables for these wind tunnel tests (23) made DOE testing an efficient option for assessing the large number of potential interactions associated with the LA-8. The general advantages and disadvantages of OFAT and DOE wind tunnel testing techniques are also discussed  along with the benefits of a combined approach. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Integration of UAM operations in the National Airspace System (NAS) has been the focus of the research conducted at NASA Ames Research Center. A simulation was performed in collaboration with Uber Technologies Inc to investigate if NASA's UTM architecture and its implementation as demonstrated in the 2019 UTM field tests were extensible for UAM operations, and if the data exchange between multiple operators as planned under UTM were adequate for UAM operations in the shared airspace. In order to explore these research questions, three Use Cases were defined to investigate different airspace management challenges. This paper will describe the lessons learned from exercising the uses cases and the airspace management services including scheduling and separation developed to facilitate initial UAM operations. 2020 IEEE.;16

Literature indicates that people, in general, have positive attitudes towards innovation and new technology. However, complex factors determine their willingness and speed in acceptance. The objective of this study was to examine which factors significantly forecast consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis. A quantitative methodology and non-experimental design were accomplished using 510 participants to develop the regression equation and assess model fit. Six significant predictors of consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis were found: familiarity, value, fun factor, wariness of new technology, fear and happiness. Three additional analyses were assessed using an independent sample of participants, revealing strong model fit. Few previous studies have provided a quantitative assessment of which factors significantly predict consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying six significant factors which account for over 76% of the variance. These findings may help the industry, manufacturers and regulators identify the types of individuals most willing to try this new form of transportation and provide more information on the type of consumer most likely to buy in to this new form of transportation. 2020 Elsevier Ltd;16

This has revealed a need to classify different types of research and examine the general characteristics of the research area. This research aims to assist in identifying the main topics and emerging research streams and provides a published overview of the current state and contributions to the area of the UAV routing problem (UAVRP) and a general categorization of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) followed by a UAVRP classification with a graphical taxonomy based on the analysis of UAVRP current status. To achieve this, an analysis of the existing research contributions promulgated in this domain is conducted. This analysis is used to identify the current state of UAVRP and the gaps related to the UAVs' flight dynamics and weather conditions, which significantly influence the fuel consumption of the UAV when modeling the UAVRP. 2020 by the authors.

These models were used to develop feedback controllers for both variable-pitch and variable-RPM variants of the quadcopter, with the handling qualities requirements determining current requirements for the electric motors. To have sufficient stability margins and bandwidth, the motor time constant for the variable-RPM system must be no greater than 0.122s. Both variable-RPM and variable-pitch systems were limited by the yaw axis, which relies on differential motor torque for control. The introduction of rotor cant alleviated this problem for the variable-pitch vehicle, allowing a 47% reduction in motor weight, relative to the uncanted variable-pitch system. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;16
10.2514/6.2018-3054;2018;J.+N.+Robinson M.+D.+Sokollek C.+Y.+Justin D.+N.+Mavris;Development Of A Methodology For Parametric Analysis Of Stol Airpark Geo-Density;Vehicles designed for urban air mobility (UAM) or on-demand mobility (ODM) applications typically adopt an architecture enabling vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. UAM or ODM systems featuring these capabilities typically have a smaller ground footprint but are subject to a number of performance compromises that make sizing and optimizing the vehicles more challenging. These design challenges can be further compounded when additional environmental considerations are taken into account and in particular if electric propulsion is considered. Alternative architectures such as short takeoff and landing (STOL) and super-short takeoff and landing (SSTOL) vehicles are thus investigated because they present possible advantages in terms of energy efficiency, overall vehicle performance, and noise footprint. However, the larger ground footprint of the infrastructure necessary to operate these systems means that these systems may be more difficult to integrate into a urban and suburban environment. One objective of this research is to estimate the geo-density of airparks suitable for STOL and SSTOL operations based on vehicle performance and ground footprint parameters. In turn, this helps establish requirements for the field performances of STOL and SSTOL vehicles to be considered for ODM and UAM applications. This research proposes and interactive and parametric design and trade-off analysis environment to help decision makers assess the suitability of candidate cities for STOL and SSTOL operations. Preliminary results for the Miami metropolitan area show that an average airpark geo-density of 1.66 airparks per square mile can be achieved with a 300 foot long runway. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

It is likely that many of the highest demand locations for vertiports will be in space constrained urban environments, requiring vertiport designs to maximize throughput within a compact surface footprint. This paper presents several generic vertiport topology design approaches and evaluates their relative surface area utilization and operational efficiency under different wind constrained configurations while meeting safety driven spacing constraints derived from heliport design standards and subject matter expert interviews. 2020 IEEE.;15

Instead of following the traditional infrastructure expansion policy, current transportation research focuses on developing innovative and novel solutions to the aforementioned issues. Current pathways to overcoming these issues include the gradual transition toward a number of emerging transportation technologies, such as, autonomous motor vehicles for human transport, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) and drone technologies for surveillance, and package deliveries. However, as a long-term solution, transportation scientists are also investigating the once-seemingly futuristic notion of flying car technologya convergent form of ground/air vehicle transportation, and assessing associated regulations. In this paper, an extensive review of current literature is conducted to explore the technological capabilities of flying carseach requiring appropriate regulations and governanceto become fully sustainable. Specifically, issues pertinent to training, safety, environment, navigation, infrastructure, logistics/sustainability, and cybersecurity and human factors are explored. This paper concludes with a preliminary quantitative analysis exploring the public perceptions associated with flying carsincluding anticipated benefits, concerns, and willingness to both hire and acquire the technology once available to consumers.

10.3390/SU12093581;2020;M.+N.+Postorino G.+M.+L.+Sarn;Reinventing Mobility Paradigms: Flying Car Scenarios And Challenges For Urban Mobility;Flying vehicles are receiving more and more attention and are becoming an opportunity to start a new urban mobility paradigm. The most interesting feature of flying cars is the expected opportunity they could offer to reduce congestion, traffic jams and the loss of time to move between origin/destination pairs in urban contexts. In this perspective, urban air mobility might meet the concept of sustainable mobility, intended as the ideal model of a transport system that minimizes the environmental impacts by maximizing efficiency and travel speed. For transport engineering planning issues, further knowledge is required in this field to understand the effects that a possible urban air mobility system, including the ground traffic component, could have in terms of sustainable mobility in the above meaning. This paper contributes to this topic by providing an analysis of different urban flying car scenarios by using an agent-based approach with different traffic conditions. The preliminary results obtained on some test networks and focusing on travel cost effects suggest that the expected advantages the flying car will depend on trip origin/destination points, average distances travelled in the urban contexts and the location of transition nodes, which are introduced as interchange nodes between aerial and ground mode. 2020 by the authors.;15
10.3390/SU12083320;2020;H.+Eifeldt;Sustainable Urban Air Mobility Supported With Participatory Noise Sensing;In about 15 years, there is likely to be urban air mobility (UAM) in larger cities across the globe. Air taxis will provide on-demand transportation for individual needs. They will also connect important transportation nodes, such as airports and city centers, as well as providing quick transfers between train stations or a convenient option for crossing rivers and lakes. It is hoped that UAM will help meet today's political targets of sustainability and decarbonization. However, there are certain threats that could impede the sustainable and thus successful introduction of UAM to our cities, with noise being a prominent limitation. This paper argues that citizens have to be viewed as stakeholders in urban air transportation, regardless of whether they or not intend to use it, and that a concept of resident participatory noise sensing (PNS) will be beneficial to the implementation of UAM. Web-based services and smartphones facilitate the access and updating of current information about local noise distributions, thus enabling them to be used to foster UAM in smart cities. 2020 by the authors.;15
N/A;2020;W.+Johnson;A Quiet Helicopter For Air Taxi Operations;NASA is exploring rotorcraft designs for VTOL air taxi operations, also known as urban air mobility (UAM) or on-demand mobility (ODM) applications. Several concept vehicles have been developed, intended to focus and guide NASA research activities in support of aircraft development for this emerging market. This paper examines a single main-rotor helicopter designed specifically for low-noise air taxi operations. Based on demonstrated technology, the aircraft uses a turboshaft engine with a sound-absorbing installation, and the NOTAR anti-torque system to eliminate tail-rotor noise, consequently the noise and annoyance of the aircraft are dominated by the main rotor. Several design parameters are explored to reduce the noise, including rotor tip speed, blade geometry, and higher-harmonic control. Commensurate with the level of design detail, the noise is calculated for compact loading and thickness sources on the rotating blades. The metric is the reduction of the noise for the helicopter certification conditions (takeoff, flyover, and approach), relative a baseline aircraft with typical (high) tip speed, conventional blade planform, and no higher-harmonic control.

The routes and procedures being explored are current-day helicopter routes along with different communication procedures that are available as tools in the near-term. Three different levels of UAM traffic were evaluated in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) area. The current-day helicopter routes were modified to separate them from traditional traffic, and a Letter of Agreement (LOA) was introduced in some of the conditions to reduce verbal communications. We found that modifications to the routes and introduction of LOA helped increase the number of UAM flights that the controllers reported they could manage and reduce their communications, which made controller self-reported workload more operationally acceptable. However, the self-reported workload experienced by busy airport towers cannot be effectively managed via the usage of LOA and modified helicopter routes, suggesting there is an opportunity to re-think roles and responsibilities of the UAM system participants. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The objective of the problem is to minimize the makespan (landing completion time) of a given set of eVTOLs, which is equivalent to maximizing the arrival throughput. The landing order (sequence) and makespan of the mixed fleet is optimized using a heuristic approach called insertion and local search (ILS) combined with two different scheduling methods i) mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) or ii) time-advance (TA) algorithm. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to see the impact of number of eVTOLs expected to land on computational times of both the algorithms. Through numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis, our algorithms demonstrated real-time scheduling capabilities for on-demand UAM arrivals, which can be used as a potential future service for UAM vertiports and terminal airspace. 2018 IEEE.;15

To address these challenges, the National Airspace System needs to undergo a transformation to a more scalable, flexible, user-focused system that addresses safety and security requirements and resiliency for current and new users. A system designed to integrate modular software services, provided by users, third parties and government for air traffic management functions, will be scalable and more easily allow modernization and for collaboration between users and service providers. ATM-X is responding to NASAs pivot towards integrating projected new, diverse entrants into the NAS, while also leveraging NASAs prior ATM achievements that continue to improve traditional airspace operations. This project is a two-phased approach to conduct research and focused evaluations to assess the feasibility of a service-based approach and to identify critical design considerations to enable airspace access for new entrants, integrated with current traditional operations. Phase 1 research will be conducted to determine what is needed to reach the ATM-X goals based on specific use-cases to enable largescale, passenger-carrying Urban Air Mobility operations in a metroplex environment, and also to improve traditional operations in the Northeast Region leveraging mature NASA technologies. Some of these evaluations will be conducted in simulations and field activities.

The proposed parallel hybrid electric powertrain includes a turboshaft engine, two electric machines, a lithium ion battery and all necessary control systems. The powertrain is modeled with an empirical but comprehensive approach in order to make possible the combination with numerical optimization algorithms. In particular, the battery is modeled with an electric equivalent circuit model that includes the effect of battery aging. The fuel consumption of the turboshaft engines is calculated with a mathematical function of power request, altitude and Mach number whose coefficients are fitted by means of comparison with the commercial code Gas-turbine Simulation Program (GSP). The optimization of the energy management of the hybrid powertrain is performed in two steps. The first one was the application of Dynamic Programming in order to obtain the optimal usage of the battery for a given mission (target values) and to provide insights into how to develop a suitable on-line optimizer to be applied during the real operation of the rotorcraft. For this second step analysis, the authors developed a version of the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy opportunely adapted to the specific case of an aerial vehicle with turboshaft engine, in particular taking in to account the desired state of charge and the actual state of health of the battery. After an off-line optimization of its parameters with a multi-objective approach, the on-line optimizer guaranteed results similar to the target values and allowed a reduction of the fuel burn ranging between 10% and 22% with respect to using only the thermal engine to power the rotor shaft and without any need to adapt the parameters in case of aged battery. 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS;14

In order to improve their aerodynamic efficiency, a better understanding of the flow-fields that occur under non-axial inflow conditions is required. Therefore, both isolated and ducted small-scale fixed-pitch propellers are analyzed at a range of inflow angles from zero to 180 degrees, to investigate their steady and temporal resolved loads. Furthermore, the influence of the inflow angle on the flow field is investigated. The load data is also used to simulate the efficiency of different configurative propulsion concepts. The aerodynamics coefficients obtained experimentally, as well as the flow field analysis by particle image velocimetry (PIV), are in close agreement with the unsteady numerical results obtained by URANS calculations. 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS;14

This paper summarizes and exemplifies means to identify and organize operational limits, followed by translation to analysis of their impact on the Urban Air Mobility system-of-systems. Operational limits are explored via an assessment of various factors using the Resources, Operations, Policies, and Economics (ROPE) table methodology. Demonstration cases explore operational limits from individual and community level perspectives in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Operational limits from individual traveler perspectives discuss the impact of peak ground traffic conditions, the impact of UAM-Port (i.e., port used for UAM vehicle landing and take-off) location, and the impact of ride sharing coupled with waiting time on the operating cost and the travel time of a commuting trip per commuter, whereas, operational limits from a community perspective discuss the impact of ground traffic congestion speed on the UAM-Port location and the impact of UAM-Port topologies and operational conditions on UAM-Port operations. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.3390/s19235133;2019;A.+Lerro A.+Brandl M.+Battipede P.+Gili;Preliminary Design Of A Model-Free Synthetic Sensor For Aerodynamic Angle Estimation For Commercial Aviation;Heterogeneity of the small aircraft category (e.g., small air transport (SAT), urban air mobility (UAM), unmanned aircraft system (UAS)), modern avionic solution (e.g., fly-by-wire (FBW)) and reduced aircraft (A/C) size require more compact, integrated, digital and modular air data system (ADS) able to measure data from the external environment. The MIDAS project, funded in the frame of the Clean Sky 2 program, aims to satisfy those recent requirements with an ADS certified for commercial applications. The main pillar lays on a smart fusion between COTS solutions and analytical sensors (patented technology) for the identification of the aerodynamic angles. The identification involves both flight dynamic relationships and data-driven state observer(s) based on neural techniques, which are deterministic once the training is completed. As this project will bring analytical sensors on board of civil aircraft as part of a redundant system for the very first time, design activities documented in this work have a particular focus on airworthiness certification aspects. At this maturity level, simulated data are used, real flight test data will be used in the next stages. Data collection is described both for the training and test aspects. Training maneuvers are defined aiming to excite all dynamic modes, whereas test maneuvers are collected aiming to validate results independently from the training set and all autopilot configurations. Results demonstrate that an alternate solution is possible enabling significant savings in terms of computational effort and lines of codes but they show, at the same time, that a better training strategy may be beneficial to cope with the new neural network architecture. 2019 by the authors.

These vehicles are typically vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) designs which are capable of carrying 1 to 30 passengers in an intra-urban environment with flights of less than 50 nautical miles. Development of UAM vehicles and their integration into the airspace will be enabled by advancements in a number of areas including electrified propulsion systems, structures, acoustics, automation, and controls. However, the strong multidisciplinary interactions for these unique vehicles presents a significant new design challenge. This work describes the development of a multidisciplinary analysis and optimization environment which can be used to support the conceptual design of these UAM vehicles, using efficient gradient based optimization with analytic derivatives. The tools included in this multidisciplinary analysis model the aircraft trajectory, vehicle aerodynamics, structures, and electrified propulsion system. The multidisciplinary environment created in this research is unique in that all the physics tools are tightly integrated together, with the trajectory model directly calling the aerodynamics, structures, and propulsion models. This multidisciplinary analysis environment is then demonstrated in the design optimization of a turboelectric tiltwing UAM vehicle concept. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2019;W.+Johnson C.+Silva;Observations From Exploration Of Vtol Urban Air Mobility Designs;NASA is exploring rotorcraft designs for VTOL air taxi operations, also known as urban air mobility (UAM) or on-demand mobility (ODM) applications. Several concept vehicles have been developed, intended to focus and guide NASA research activities in support of aircraft development for this emerging market. This paper summarizes the work conducted to date. To initially explore the broad design trade-space, three concept vehicles were designed: a quadrotor with electric propulsion, a side-by-side helicopter with hybrid propulsion, and a tiltwing with turbo-electric propulsion. Next a specific UAM mission was developed, accounting for the existing geography, population patterns, infrastructure, and weather in twenty-eight markets across the United States of America. Then in order to quantify the tradeoffs and performance targets necessary for practical implementation of the UAM vision, aircraft were designed to perform this mission, considering a range of aircraft types and propulsion system architectures: quadrotor aircraft, with turboshaft and all-electric propulsion, side-by-side aircraft, with turboshaft and all-electric propulsion, and lift+cruise aircraft with all-electric and turbo-electric propulsion. In examining these vehicles, performance targets and recurring technology themes emerged, which can guide investments in research and development within NASA, other government agencies, academia, and industry. In addition, results from the designs support observations about the trade-offs and key design decisions. 2019 The Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;14

This work is a step towards a comprehensive ODM vehicle analysis capability. The authors use 6DOF equations of motion to model the electric quad-rotor concept developed by NASA's Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technologies program. As a first step towards acoustic analysis, this trajectory is coupled to an acoustic model that tracks the sound pressure level perceived by an acoustic observer on the ground. The results show that the approach is successful in finding trajectories that minimize total propulsive impulse while obeying limits imposed on the sound pressure level. Future work will involve adding acoustic analysis of increasing fidelity and tying the resulting trajectories to the performance of the electric propulsion system. 2018 AIAA.;14

Urban air mobility (UAM), i.e., the on-demand concept that utilizes eVTOL aircraft, might substantially reduce travel times when compared to ground-based transportation. Trips of three, pre-existent, and calibrated agent-based transport scenarios (Munich Metropolitan Region, le-de-France, and San Francisco Bay Area) have been routed using the UAM-extension for the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) to calculate congested trip travel times for each trips original modei.e., car or public transport (PT)and UAM. The resulting travel times are compared and allow the deduction of potential UAM trip shares under varying UAM properties, such as the number of stations, total process time, and cruise flight speed. Under base-case conditions, the share of motorized trips for which UAM would reduce the travel times ranges between 3% and 13% across the three scenarios. Process times and number of stations heavily influence these potential shares, where the vast majority of UAM trips would be below 50 km in range. Compared to car usage, UAMs (base case) travel times are estimated to be competitive beyond the range of a 50-min car ride and are less than half as much influenced by congestion. 2021 by the authors.

We leverage the Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV) framework and integrate it with the systems simulation approach. Upon investigation, we find that all the parameters linearly impact the vehicle utilization, while other measures are robust, specifically with respect to the seating capacity.

10.2514/6.2020-0660;2020;J.+R.+Bertram P.+Wei;An Efficient Algorithm For Self-Organized Terminal Arrival In Urban Air Mobility;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a concept for future air transportation where air taxis move passengers between vertical take-off and landing sites known as vertiports. While some form of a structured airspace is likely, it is expected that UAM systems will be required to deal with high traffic densities and will need to respond to conflicts due to a dynamically changing environment. Due to the difficulty of predicting demand of air taxi usage, it may also be more difficult to predict the required demand on any given vertiport. We explore an airspace design which can regulate the flow of aircraft landing at a vertiport, maintaining the aircraft in sequence until capacity is available at the vertiport. We demonstrate an implementation of the airspace design using a highly-efficient Markov Decision Process (MDP) based algorithm to provide separation and collision avoidance for a UAM terminal arrival sequencing problem. The vertiport maintains basic information about capacity and sequencing, and the aircraft seamlessly perform guidance in a self-organized distributed manner performing conflict avoidance while waiting to land. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2019;W.+N.+Alexander J.+Whelchel;Flyover Noise Of Multi-Rotor Suas;Drone delivery and urban air mobility concepts often employ multi-rotor VTOL configurations. These vehicles are designed to operate within urban environments potentially exposing communities to significant levels of tonal and broadband noise. Acoustic regulations or operational guidelines do not exist to minimize the impact of these flights on surrounding communities. Recent work at Virginia Tech is focused on understanding the noise produced by these platforms in-flight, particularly during maneuver, and its impact on ground observers. Acoustic measurements of multi-copter drone flyovers have been conducted in the drone park at Virginia Tech including the basic maneuvers of hover and forward flight. Three distinct frequency regions are identified in the sound spectra relating to the tonal noise, broadband interaction noise, and rotor self-noise. Comparison of the noise produced in hover and forward flight reveals the influence of directivity on the measured sound at a receiver and should be accounted for in estimates of community impact.

10.1017/aer.2021.92;2022;W.+Johnson C.+Silva;Nasa Concept Vehicles And The Engineering Of Advanced Air Mobility Aircraft;NASA is conducting investigations in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) aircraft and operations. AAM missions are characterised by ranges below 300 nm, including rural and urban operations, passenger carrying as well as cargo delivery. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a subset of AAM and is the segment that is projected to have the most economic benefit and be the most difficult to develop. The NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology project is developing UAM VTOL aircraft designs that can be used to focus and guide research activities in support of aircraft development for emerging aviation markets. These NASA concept vehicles encompass relevant UAM features and technologies, including propulsion architectures, highly efficient yet quiet rotors, and aircraft aerodynamic performance and interactions. The configurations adopted are generic, intentionally different in appearance and design detail from prominent industry arrangements. Already these UAM concept aircraft have been used in numerous engineering investigations, including work on meeting safety requirements, achieving good handling qualities, and reducing noise below helicopter certification levels.

10.1109/TITS.2020.3048360;2021;X.+Yang P.+Wei;Autonomous Free Flight Operations In Urban Air Mobility With Computational Guidance And Collision Avoidance;The use of electrical vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to provide efficient, high-speed, on-demand air transportation within a metropolitan area is a topic of increasing interest, which is expected to bring fundamental changes to the city infrastructures and daily commutes. NASA, Uber, and Airbus have been exploring this exciting concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), which has the potential to provide meaningful door-to-door trip time savings compared with automobiles. However, the ability to manage many of these eVTOL aircraft safely in a congested urban area presents a challenge unprecedented in air traffic management. In order to enable safe and efficient autonomous on-demand free flight operations in UAM, a computational guidance algorithm with collision avoidance capability is designed and analyzed. The approach proposed in this paper is to formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve it using an online algorithm Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For illustration, a high-density free flight airspace simulator is created to test the proposed algorithm's performance. Numerical experiment results show that this proposed algorithm has fewer conflicts and near mid-air collisions than Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision avoidance strategy. 2000-2011 IEEE.;12

Their unique operating profiles and requirements present grand challenges to batteries. This work identifies the primary battery requirements for eVTOL in terms of specific energy and power, fast charging, cycle life, and safety, revealing that eVTOL batteries have more stringent requirements than electric vehicle batteries in all aspects. Notably, we find that fast charging is essential for downsizing aircraft and batteries for low cost while achieving high vehicle utilization rates to maximize revenues. We experimentally demonstrate two energy-dense Li-ion battery designs that can recharge adequate energy for 80 km eVTOL trips in 510 min and sustain over 2,000 fast-charge cycles, laying a foundation for eVTOL batteries. 2021 Elsevier Inc.;12
10.3390/su13137421;2021;R.+Goyal C.+Reiche C.+Fernando A.+Cohen;Advanced Air Mobility: Demand Analysis And Market Potential Of The Airport Shuttle And Air Taxi Markets;Advanced air mobility (AAM) is a broad concept enabling consumers access to on-demand air mobility, cargo and package delivery, healthcare applications, and emergency services through an integrated and connected multimodal transportation network. However, a number of challenges could impact AAM's growth potential, such as autonomous flight, the availability of take-off and landing infrastructure (i.e., vertiports), integration into airspace and other modes of transportation, and competition with shared automated vehicles. This article discusses the results of a demand analysis examining the market potential of two potential AAM passenger markets-airport shuttles and air taxis. The airport shuttle market envisions AAM passenger service to, from, or between airports along fixed routes. The air taxi market envisions a more mature and scaled service that provides on-demand point-to-point passenger services throughout urban areas. Using a multi-method approach consisting of AAM travel demand modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and constraint analysis, this study estimates that the air taxi and airport shuttle markets could capture a 0.5% mode share. The analysis concludes that AAM could replace non-discretionary trips greater than 45 min, however, demand for discretionary trips would be limited by consumer willingness to pay. This study concludes that AAM passenger services could have a daily demand of 82,000 passengers served by approximately 4000 four- to five-seat aircraft in the U.S., under the most conservative scenario, representing an annual market valuation of 2.5 billion USD. 2021 by the authors.

UAM is a concept mode of transportation that is designed to bypass ground congestion for time-sensitive, price-inelastic travelers using autonomous, electric aircraft with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. This study focuses specifically on commuting trips, which are frequent and considered relatively more time-sensitive than other types of personal trips. The UAM mode's feasibility is studied using sensitivity analysis of UAM demand to cost per passenger mile and the number of vertiports placed in the region. This study also explores the spatial distribution of UAM demand in Northern California, which further helps in identifying the major commuter trip-attraction and trip-production zones for the UAM mode in the region. The results indicate that sufficient UAM demand for commuting trips can only be reached at optimistically low UAM offered fares. These fare levels could be challenging to obtain given the high real estate cost in Northern California's urban regions. Moreover, the reliability of the UAM mode must be comparable to the automobile mode, otherwise, it loses significant demand with increasing delays. The results also show that the commuting flows with promising UAM demand in Northern California are heavily one-directional, with San Francisco Financial District being a major attraction. Other types of trips should also be considered along with commuting trips to generate an economically viable system and reduce deadheading. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;12

Several ride-related factors (such as month of the year, day of the week and time of the day) and weather-related variables (such as temperature, weather conditions and visibility) are used as predictors for four popular MLAs, namely, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, random forests, and gradient boosting. Experimental results suggest gradient boosting to consistently provide higher prediction performance. Specific locations, certain time periods and weekdays consistently emerged as critical predictors. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;12
10.1007/s13272-021-00514-w;2021;A.+Straubinger J.+Michelmann T.+Biehle;Business Model Options For Passenger Urban Air Mobility;While technological progress towards passenger urban air mobility (UAM) receives high attention, relevant business models for the deployment of these increasingly sophisticated passenger-carrying air vehicles for urban applications get less attention. However, especially in early market stages with high risks of investment and in respect to an often envisioned implementation of transport services in the proximity of urban settlements, it is important that the technology adds value to society. In this paper relevant perspectives to comprehend the current UAM business environment are presented. Possible operator models and customer segments are compiled and matched in three concrete business model approaches for passenger UAM. Scrutinising UAM Airport Shuttle Services shows that even concepts with sufficient demand might still not be adequate for a valid business case due to incomplete and a so far insufficient critical analysis of the overall operational environment. Second, a so far often unconsidered business model for a Company Shuttle Service is introduced, addressing the problem of scaling up UAM services with a dynamically expandable Business-to-Business (B2B) concept. Third, UAM will be discussed as part of public transport, introducing a business model that is inclusive and in strong line with public demands. Finally, these rather different implementation concepts unlock the space for an open-minded discussion on business models in the field of passenger UAM in general. 2021, Deutsches Zentrum fr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.;12

Therefore, airspace classifications and structures need to evolve based on appropriate performance metrics, while new models and tools are needed to address UTM operational requirements, with an increasing focus on the coexistence of manned and unmanned Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles and associated Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) infrastructure. This paper presents a novel airspace model for UTM adopting Performance-Based Operation (PBO) criteria, and specifically addressing urban airspace requirements. In particular, a novel airspace discretisation methodology is introduced, which allows dynamic management of airspace resources based on navigation and surveillance performance. Additionally, an airspace sectorisation methodology is developed balancing the trade-off between communication overhead and computational complexity of trajectory planning and re-planning. Two simulation case studies are conducted: over the skyline and below the skyline in Melbourne central business district, utilising Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). The results confirm that the proposed airspace sectorisation methodology promotes operational safety and efficiency and enhances the UTM operators situational awareness under dense traffic conditions introducing a new effective 3D airspace visualisation scheme, which is suitable both for mission planning and pre-tactical UTM operations. Additionally, the proposed performance-based methodology can accommodate the diversity of infrastructure and vehicle performance requirements currently envisaged in the UTM context. This facilitates the adoption of this methodology for low-level airspace integration of UAS (which may differ significantly in terms of their avionics CNS capabilities) and set foundations for future work on tactical online UTM operations. 2020 by the authors.

This paper proposes a novel path planning algorithm based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT) in conjunction with chance constrained formulation to handle uncertain environmental obstacles. Chance constrained formulation for uncertain obstacles under Gaussian noise is developed by converting the probabilistic constraints into deterministic constraints equivalently. The probabilistically feasible region at every time step can be established through the simulation of the system state and the evaluation of probabilistic constraints. By combining chance constrained formulation with RRTalgorithm, our proposed strategy not only enjoys the benefits of sampling-based algorithms but also incorporates uncertainty into the formulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can generate probabilistically guaranteed collision-free paths for urban air mobility operations. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In our previous work, we have introduced computational guidance algorithms for single aircraft and multiple cooperative aircraft to navigate through obstacles and avoid conflicts among aircraft. However, we assumed perfect communications for air-to-air and ground-to-air channels. In this paper, we formulate the computational guidance problem with communication constraints and communication loss. Specifically, our goal in this paper is to (1) modify our computational guidance algorithms given communication constraints, e.g., time, bandwidth, and communication loss, (2) design air-to-air and air-to-ground communication frameworks to facilitate the computational guidance algorithm, and (3) integrate the decision making and communication mechanisms to guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts between them.

A coordination mechanism is designed to manage multiple cooperative aircraft. By generating real-time actions for all the cooperative aircraft to follow, the algorithm can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts between them. For the sake of illustration, a free flight airspace simulator is created to test the performance of this algorithm. Results show that this algorithm can help all the aircraft reach their trip destinations while only having 0.2% conflicts during the flights. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

As several urban air mobility (UAM) concepts are conceivable, all relevant physical effects as well as mutual interrelations of the UAM system have to be addressed and evaluated at a sufficient level of fidelity before implementation. Therefore, a collaborative system of systems modeling approach for UAM is presented. To quickly identify physical effects and cross-disciplinary influences of UAM, a pool of low-fidelity physical analysis components is developed and integrated into the Remote Component Environment (RCE) workflow engine. This includes, i. a., the disciplines of demand forecast, trajectory, vertiport, and cost modeling as well as air traffic flow and capacity management. The definition and clarification of technical interfaces require intensive cooperation between specialists with different areas of expertise. To reduce this communication effort, the Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema (CPACS) is adapted and used as central data exchange format. The UAM system module is initially applied for a 24-hour simulation of three generic networks in Hamburg City. After understanding the basic system-level behavior, higher level analysis components and feedback loops must be integrated in the UAM system module for evaluation and optimization of explicit operating concepts. 2020 by the authors.;11
N/A;2020;S.+Withrow-Maser C.+Malpica K.+Nagami;Multirotor Configuration Trades Informed By Handling Qualities For Urban Air Mobility Application;Many contemporary Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), and more specifically, urban air mobility (UAM) vehicle designers are attracted to variable rotor speed-controlled designs with multiple rotors because of the great potential for mass savings compared to more traditional, variable blade pitch-controlled vehicles. These designs are based on the assumption that the stability and control of recreation or basic utility-sized drones can be scaled to larger passenger-sized vehicles. Previous work had shown the challenges in stabilizing passenger-sized quadcopters. In this study, power constraints were made less restrictive and varied, allowing more control power. Motor parameters such as efficiency, nominal voltage and current operating point, and rise time of the rotor speed controller step response were studied. By fixing the efficiency of the motor to 95% and assuming a motor voltage to current ratio of 2.0 (previously, assumed to be 1.0), the authors were able to stabilize the quadcopter in the roll axis because this allowed the vehicle to achieve adequate rise times between 0.4 and 0.8 s. This motor optimization was extended to a hexacopter and octocopter designed to the same payload size and mission as the quadcopter. The three vehicle configurations and their motor speed controllers were compared. It was found that while hexacopter and octocopter required more mass and overall power, all three configurations had similar margins required for control. However, the hexacopter and octocopter were able to use this power margin to achieve lower rise times (i.e. the vehicle responded more quickly to pilot inputs) than the quadcopter, with the octocopter having the lowest rotor response rise time of the three vehicle configurations studied. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;11
N/A;2020;M.+Bahr M.+Mckay R.+Niemiec F.+Gandhi;Handling Qualities Assessment Of Large Variable-Rpm Multi-Rotor Aircraft For Urban Air Mobility;Optimization-based control design techniques are applied to multicopters with variable-RPM rotors. The handling qualities and motor current requirements of a quadcopter, hexacopter, and octocopter with equal gross weights (1200 lb) and total disk areas (producing a 6 lb/ft2 disk loading) are compared to one another in hover. For axes that rely on the rotor thrust (all except yaw), the increased inertia of the larger rotors on the quadcopter increase the current requirement, relative to vehicles with fewer, smaller rotors. Both the quadcopter and hexacopter have maximum current margin requirements (relative to hover) during a step command in longitudinal velocity. In yaw, rotor inertia is irrelevant, as the reaction torque of the motor is the same whether the rotor is accelerating or overcoming drag. This, combined with the octocopter's greater inertia as well as the fact that it requires 30% less current to drive its motors in hover, results in the octocopter requiring the greatest current margin, relative to hover conditions. To meet handling qualities requirements, the total weight of the motors of the octocopter and hexacopter is comparable at 15% weight fraction, but the quadcopter's motors are heavier, requiring 17% weight fraction. If the longitudinal and lateral axes were flown in ACAH mode, rather than TRC mode, the total motor weight of all configurations would be nearly identical, requiring about 14.6% weight fraction for motors (compared to 8-9% weight fraction from hover torque requirements). 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;11

The scheduler models each vertiport by the number of vertipads and parking spaces, and manages reservations on timelines for those vertiport resources, at a level of fidelity suitable for fast-time and system-level analyses of UAM concepts and other airspace studies. The paper defines the theoretical model that can be used to estimate the capacity of various vertiport configurations. The theoretical model provides an understanding of the conditions that can lead to either a parking space-limited or a vertipad-limited vertiport. Examples of potential throughput for some vertiport configurations are provided using both a queueing approach as well as a simulated UAM demand scenario. The study demonstrated that a first-come, first-served scheduling approach can have inefficiencies in the use of the vertiport resources. The inefficiencies can increase as the number of resources increases. Nonetheless, 80% or better peak throughput to capacity ratio was observed for most vertiport configurations. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-3255;2019;A.+Mathur K.+Panesar J.+Kim E.+Atkins N.+Sarter;Paths To Autonomous Vehicle Operations For Urban Air Mobility;Realization of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vision will require a transition from one or more pilots flying each aircraft to large numbers of aircraft managed by a much smaller number of ground-based operators. This paper summarizes key challenges in the context of technology, regulatory, and stakeholder evolution that need to be addressed before large-scale UAM can be realized. Two complementary vehicle-centric paths leading from existing concepts of operation to autonomous UAM are described. One path, denoted the Piloted Aircraft Path, focuses on how pilots and air traffic controller roles, responsibilities, and training must evolve to prepare for autonomous UAM. The Piloted Aircraft Path calls for incremental introduction of new autonomy modules and displays, moving first to single-pilot operations after which the single-pilot moves offboard and is replaced by a ground-based monitoring and control station. The second path, the Pilotless Aircraft Path, describes how autonomy and communication technologies must advance such that existing concepts of operation for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) can become sufficiently safe to ultimately support passenger payloads. To conclude, we compare and contrast the two paths and discuss how support systems such as resilient datalink, airspace allocation, and maintenance are critical for both of them. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-1219;2019;D.+Ingraham J.+Gray L.+V.+Lopes;Gradient-Based Propeller Optimization With Acoustic Constraints;Urban Air Mobility vehicles are intended to operate near or within large cities, where a significant portion of the public will be exposed to the noise they create. If these vehicles are to become acceptable to the public, designers must be able to manage the amount of noise they generate, and understand the relationship between traditional performance metrics (thrust, efficiency, etc.) and noise. As a first step to addressing this need, this work combines a blade element momentum theory tool (OpenBEMT) with an acoustic prediction tool (ANOPP2) to optimize a propeller subject to both aerodynamic and acoustic constraints. These tools are developed within a optimization framework (OpenMDAO) that allows analytic derivatives to be propagated through the models and passed to a gradient-based optimizer. This toolchain is exercised on the cruise propellers from the X-57 Maxwell, and yields propeller designs that reduced the overall sound pressure level by about 5 dB for a cost of 1% propeller efficiency. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved on overset grids employing highorder accurate schemes, dual-time stepping, and a hybrid turbulence model using NASA's CFD code Overflow. The vehicles studied consist of small to medium sized drones, and bigger vehicles for future Urban Air Mobility (UAM) applications. The performances for different configurations and rotor mounting are calculated in hover and in forward flight.

10.2514/6.2018-3667;2018;M.+R.+Lowry;Towards High Density Urban Air Mobility;A candidate architecture is presented for high density urban air mobility (UAM) operations that elevates a significant portion of urban traffic from surface automobile to aircraft operating below 4,000 feet. This conceptual architecture is targeted towards the years 2030 and beyond. The architecture is an exploration of airspace features and air traffic control requirements that would need to be satisfied in order to enable orders of magnitude increases in aircraft operations. High density requires channelization of high-throughput portions of the airspace to manage pair-wise conflicts. This leads to the requirement to merge different streams of traffic without leading to congestion. Three-dimensional airspace provides an extra degree of freedom for merging that is not readily available for surface traffic, the paper describes algorithms and simulation results. Ascent and descent need to be accommodated in order for traffic to reach different channels, without requiring large volumes of airspace. An airspace construct  elevators  is described that minimizes the volume needed for ascent/descent, and thus maximizes the volume that can be devoted to high-throughput channelized traffic. The overall architecture is balanced in terms of throughput between vertiports, local traffic, elevators, and high throughput channels. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.1109/TITS.2020.3048364;2021;C.+Reiche A.+P.+Cohen C.+Fernando;An Initial Assessment Of The Potential Weather Barriers Of Urban Air Mobility;Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a subset of advanced air mobility, is a concept that envisions safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation for passenger mobility, cargo delivery, and emergency management within or traversing a metropolitan area. In recent years, several companies have designed and tested enabling elements of this concept, including, prototypes of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, operational concepts, and market studies to understand potential business models. While UAM may be enabled by the convergence of several factors, a number of barriers such as weather could present challenges to scaling operations. This research discusses the potential weather and public acceptance challenges for operations in adverse conditions. This article presents a comprehensive seasonal and diurnal climatology analysis using historical observations across anticipated operational altitudes (surface- 5000 ft AGL) at ten metropolitan areas across the United States for the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). Public perceptions of weather-related societal barriers were evaluated through a five-city general population survey (n = 1,702) where respondents were asked about their views regarding flying in a small aircraft in a variety of adverse weather conditions using a six statement 5-point Likert scale. The results of the climatology analysis found weather most favorable in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with much less favorable conditions in Denver, New York City, and Washington D.C. In the future, equipping automated vehicles, unmanned aircraft systems, and VTOLs with meteorological sensors coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence could enhance predictive capabilities that reduce flight cancellations and delays for travelers. 2000-2011 IEEE.;10

Electric power and propulsion system is one of the key technologies for commercial applications of flying cars. Therefore, it is essential to study the power battery operating characteristics under typical flight mission profiles for flying cars. This paper summarizes the relevant researches on the power battery operating performance under the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) mission profile and builds up the theoretical model of the flying car. Based on the MATLAB Simulink, the simulation and analysis of power batteries are carried out under the designed mission profile for flying cars. After simulation, it's found that the power and discharge rate at the end of the vertical climb acceleration segment are the highest in the entire mission profile, where the discharge rate reaches 6.4C. And the speed, acceleration and climb height have an important impact on the characteristics of the power battery and the recharge mileage of the flying car. 2021 Elsevier B.V.;10

Here, we demonstrate an energy-dense lithium-ion battery (LiB) with ultralong cycle life under ultrafast charging. By using the asymmetric temperature modulation (ATM) method, i.e., charging at an elevated temperature and discharging around the ambient temperature, it is experimentally shown that the 209 Wh/kg LiB is charged to 88% state of charge (SOC) in 5 min under UAM cycling while retaining 97.7% capacity after 1,000 cycles. Moreover, an experimentally validated electrochemical-thermal (ECT) model is developed to elucidate the fast charging process and the degradation mode of UAM batteries, quantitatively capturing lithium plating during fast charging. We find that the LiBs for UAM applications are most prone to lithium plating due to their higher initial SOC required as the reserve for safety, nevertheless, the ATM method is effective in minimizing or preventing lithium plating in the high SOC range of 30-90%. In addition to slowing down capacity fade, the ATM method also raises the usable capacity by 10%, which boosts the battery energy density and ensures the battery to perform full UAM cycles even at the end of life. 2021 Elsevier B.V.;10

The addition of these vehicles to the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market would provide more options for short to medium distance aerial transportation, filling the niche that is currently occupied by helicopters. However, the costs and benefits of adopting these vehicles are reliant on many different factors related to both the aircraft and its operating environment. This paper compares 13 UAM vehicles (12 emerging eVTOL vehicles and one helicopter) using a Direct Operating Cost (DOC) model developed by the authors to compute economic metrics. With the computed DOC values for each vehicle, a computational framework determines, from a set of known passenger trips in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, the number of passenger trips that would use UAM as part of the total trip. These assessments use a specific network of aerodromes in the Chicago Metropolitan Area using existing sites that could support UAM aircraft operations. From the results, we infer important vehicle characteristics and preferable vehicle configurations for the specific aerodrome network that lead to the highest number of passenger trips utilizing UAM. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

N/A;2021;P.+C.+Murphy P.+G.+Buning B.+M.+Simmons;Rapid Aero Modeling For Urban Air Mobility Aircraft In Computational Experiments;Rapid Aero Modeling (RAM) applied to computational testing, RAM-C, is an approach to efficiently and automatically obtain aerodynamic models during computational investigations. RAM-C is designed to estimate models appropriate for flight dynamics studies and simulations. The approach responds to a demand for experimental efficiency and model fidelity that has increased with growing aircraft complexity and aerodynamic nonlinearities associated with hybrid and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. In an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) transportation system, it is expected that aircraft will embrace many features from both airplanes and rotorcraft. These vehicles present many more factors than conventional aircraft which can lead to increased computational costs and missed key factor interactions when applying traditional testing and modeling methods. RAM-C provides feedback loops around computational codes to rapidly guide testing toward aerodynamic models meeting user-defined fidelity goals. It combines and extends concepts from design of experiment theory and aircraft system identification theory that allow the user the freedom to choose, in advance of the test, a specific level of fidelity in terms of prediction error. RAM-C only collects enough data required to meet the user-specified prediction error requirements thus saving computational time and resources. The overall achievable fidelity of the final model also depends on the accuracy of the test facility, or in this case, the computational modeling approach. Previous studies to support development of the RAM-T process were conducted in wind tunnel tests to assess potential metrics, algorithms, and procedures. This paper presents results from the next steps taken and tests conducted for the development of RAM-C technology and highlights some of the unique features of RAM applied eVTOL configurations in a computational study. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Personal aerial vehicles have been studied since the dawn of commercial flight, but in recent years, these concepts experienced a revival due to novel technologies such as distributed electric propulsion and automation. Infrastructure has been identified by many institutions independently as being among the key constraints for scaling operations. The central infrastructural units in the system, the vertiports, have been studied substantially in terms of locations and networks. At the same time, ground operations on the airfield have been largely neglected, especially dynamic effects and delays emerging from operational contingencies. This paper attempts to illuminate the processes taking place on a vertiport through introducing an agent-based modeling and simulation framework for vertiport ground operations. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Motivation for this technology results from demand for experimental efficiency and model fidelity that has increased with growing aircraft complexity and aerodynamic nonlinearities. These issues are typical in the responses presented by a class of vehicles categorized as Urban Air Mobility aircraft where many features from both airplane and rotorcraft are present. For UAM configurations, with typically many more factors than conventional aircraft, traditional test methods can lead to increased costs and missed interactions. RAM guides the test to obtain high-fidelity, statistically rigorous aircraft models, and the approach is applicable to computational, ground, or flight-test experiments. It combines concepts from Design of Experiment theory and Aircraft System Identification theory that allow the user the freedom to choose, in advance of the test, a specific level of fidelity typically, in terms of prediction error. RAM only collects data required to meet the user-specified fidelity and fidelity is only limited by the facility and test article capabilities. An initial wind tunnel test to support development of RAM was conducted to assess potential metrics, algorithms, and procedures. This paper presents results from initial tests for the development of RAM technology and highlights some of the unique features of RAM applied to a conventional configuration during a ground-based, static, wind-tunnel test. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-3626;2019;N.+M.+Guerreiro R.+W.+Butler J.+M.+Maddalon G.+E.+Hagen;Mission Planner Algorithm For Urban Air Mobility  Initial Performance Characterization;In this paper, the initial specification of a Mission Planner algorithm developed by NASA for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations research is provided and an initial performance characterization of that algorithm is performed. The algorithm plans conflict-free trajectories for flights to support a given set of UAM passenger trips. The UAM trips are planned in an on-demand, first-come, first-served manner, such that any given trip is subject to the constraints imposed by previously planned trips. For this analysis, the mission planning algorithm considered only the trajectory constraints from previously-planned trips in one test condition and added vertiport constraints for the second test condition. The conflict and constraint resolution strategies used by the Mission Planner were characterized by their percentage contribution to planning iterations, their percentage effectiveness in those iterations, and their contributions to the departure delay applied to each UAM trips flight. With the exception of the climb and descent vertical speed strategies, most strategies showed reasonable or good performance in all test scenarios. In the test condition with vertipad constraints enabled, both the total number of iterations executed, and the number of flights that required planning iterations, was reduced for all scenarios. This was the result of the natural conditioning of the traffic achieved with scheduling and the additional information available to the Mission Planner from the vertiport scheduler. The next steps for this work will include improvements to the mission planning strategies and analyses with additional constraints and under other demand scenarios. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2018-3674;2018;W.+B.+Cotton D.+J.+Wing;Airborne Trajectory Management For Urban Air Mobility;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has captured the imagination of the public and the aviation industry for someday soon moving people and goods through and around metropolitan areas using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) that are electrically powered, environmentally friendly, and autonomously operated. Significant investment and rapid development of vehicles for this activity is taking place, with package delivery services already beginning in some areas. However, the ability to manage thousands of these vehicles safely in a congested urban area presents a challenge unprecedented in air traffic management. Initial studies of this problem led by NASA under the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) initiative have primarily focused on geo-fencing and centralized reservation of airspace for individual flights. This paper proposes an extension of UTM using a de-centralized approach employing airborne surveillance, self-separation, and a minimized design separation approach to permit the optimization and safety of each flight in very high traffic densities and close proximities. The concept employs Airborne Trajectory Management (ABTM) principles and a novel new concept for variable separation criteria to manage the angular velocity of a passing vehicle, thus eliminating the startle factor and perceived hazard of very close operations. ABTM also accomplishes most of the services required for safe planning and execution of normal flights and recovery from abnormal or emergency operations while accommodating conventional piloted flights using the current air traffic control paradigm. The environment for UAM operations is described along with the proposed means for autonomous, tactical separation of the vehicles. Sample geometries of traffic conflicts and resolutions are shown and the airspace definitions, rules for flight within them, and additions and exemptions to the rules for these flights are listed and explained. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

ISHM fundamentally relies on assessments and predictions of system health, including the early detection of failures and estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Model-based, data-driven or hybrid reasoning techniques can be utilized to maximise the timeliness and reliability of diagnosis and prognosis information. The benefits of ISHM include enhancing the maintainability, reliability, safety and performance of systems. The next evolution of the ISHM concept, Intelligent Health and Mission Management (IHMM), delves deeper into the utilization of on-line system health predictions to modify mission profiles to ensure safety and reliability, as well as efficiency through predictive integrity. This concept is particularly important for Trusted Autonomous System (TAS) applications, where an accurate assessment of the current and future system state-of-health to make operational decisions (with or without human intervention) is integral to both flight safety and mission success. IHMM systems introduce the capability of predicting degradation in the functional performance of subsystems, with sufficient time to dynamically identify which appropriate restorative or reconfiguration actions to take in order to ensure that the system can perform at an acceptable level of operational capability before the onset of a failure event. This paper reviews some of the key advancements and contributions to knowledge in the field of ISHM for the aerospace industry, with a particular focus on various architectures and reasoning strategies involving the use of artificial intelligence. The paper also discusses the key challenges faced in the development and deployment of ISHM systems in the aerospace industry and highlights the safety-critical role that IHMM will play in future cyber-physical and autonomous system applications (both vehicle and ground support systems), such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM), Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). 2021 The Authors;9

To justify public investment, UAM must serve urban mobility by carrying a significant portion of urban traffic. We develop a traffic demand analysis method to estimate the maximum number of people that can benefit from UAM, for a given use case, in a metropolitan region. We apply our method to about three hundred thousand cross-bay commute trips in the San Francisco Bay Area. We estimate the commuter demand shift to UAM under two criteria of flexibility to travel time savings and three criteria of vertiport transfer times. Our results indicate that even for commuters with high value of time, and long transfer times at vertiports, almost forty-five percent of demand would benefit from UAM when the roads are highly congested. Even when the roads are mostly free, about three percent of the demand can benefit from UAM with the right combination of commuter flexibility and transfer times. Finally, our method also produces the number, location and distribution of demand over vertiports that can support value proposition, policy-making and technology research for UAM. 2000-2011 IEEE.;9
10.3390/aerospace8020038;2021;M.+Doole J.+Ellerbroek V.+L.+Knoop J.+M.+Hoekstra;Constrained Urban Airspace Design For Large-Scale Drone-Based Delivery Traffic;Large-scale adoption of drone-based delivery in urban areas promise societal benefits with respect to emissions and on-ground traffic congestion, as well as potential cost savings for drone-based logistic companies. However, for this to materialise, the ability of accommodating high volumes of drone traffic in an urban airspace is one of the biggest challenges. For unconstrained airspace, it has been shown that traffic alignment and segmentation can be used to mitigate conflict probability. The current study investigates the application of these principles to a highly constrained airspace. We propose two urban airspace concepts, applying road-based analogies of two-way and one-way streets by imposing horizontal structure. Both of the airspace concepts employ heading-altitude rules to vertically segment cruising traffic according to their travel direction. These airspace configurations also feature transition altitudes to accommodate turning flights that need to decrease the flight speed in order to make safe turns at intersections. While using fast-time simulation experiments, the performance of these airspace concepts is compared and evaluated for multiple traffic demand densities in terms of safety, stability, and efficiency. The results reveal that an effective way to structure drone traffic in a constrained urban area is to have vertically segmented altitude layers with respect to travel direction as well as horizontal constraints imposed to the flow of traffic. The study also makes recommendations for areas of future research, which are aimed at supporting dynamic traffic demand patterns. 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;9

The project HorizonUAM  Urban Air Mobility Research at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) provides first answers to this vision by pooling existing competencies of individual institutes within DLR. HorizonUAM combines research about urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, the corresponding infrastructure, the operation of UAM services, as well as public acceptance and market development of future urban air transportation. Competencies and current research topics including propulsion technologies, flight system technologies, communication and navigation go along in conjunction with the findings of modern flight guidance and airport technology techniques. The project analyses possible UAM market scenarios up to the year 2050 and assesses economic aspects such as the degree of vehicle utilization or cost-benefit potential via an overall system model. Furthermore, the system design for future air taxis is carried out on the basis of vehicle family concepts, onboard systems, aspects of safety and security as well as the certification of autonomy functions. The analysis of flight guidance concepts and the sequencing of air taxis at vertidromes is another central part of the project. Selected concepts for flight guidance, communication and navigation technology will also be demonstrated with drones in a scaled urban scenario.

N/A;2021;C.+Silva W.+Johnson;Practical Conceptual Design Of Quieter Urban Vtol Aircraft;A toolchain and process for conceptual design of VTOL rotorcraft, employing low- and mid-fidelity tools is presented. The approach is capable of providing more quantitatively-credible trades between noise, size, and cost metrics than the methods commonly used for conceptual design. In addition to a general conceptual design tool, the approach employs comprehensive analysis for trim, blade motion, and airloads, these are then used by acoustic analysis software to develop source sound, propagate it, and calculate noise metrics. A key aspect of the approach is flexibility to assess varied aircraft types and different technologies and design features. Vehicles are sized using a representative Urban Air Mobility design mission. Demonstration cases are presented for a single main rotor helicopter, quadrotor, side-by-side helicopter, and lift+cruise aircraft. Noise metrics used for demonstration are the FAA/EASA certification Effective Perceived Noise Levels for takeoff, flyover, and approach. The concept aircraft in this study are shown to achieve reductions in noise relative the initial design points, with changes in mission performance and cost as a consequence. Many of the designs are predicted to be tens of EPNdB quieter in the certification metrics than existing helicopters. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;9
N/A;2021;J.+Bain G.+V.+Miki A.+Stoll;Aerodynamic And Acoustic Design Of The Joby Aviation Evtol Propeller;Joby Aviation is developing a six propeller, all electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for the Urban Air Mobility mission. The two primary design goals of this aircraft are safety and low noise. The aircraft is designed for high density operations near residences and workplaces, so it is imperative that the acoustic emissions of the aircraft are minimized for community acceptance. After flight testing the initial full scale prototype aircraft, a redesign process was undertaken to further improve the propeller acoustics. This process included rapid composite manufacturing to enable experimental tests of intermediate designs. The propellers were initially designed using a low fidelity lifting line and prescribed wake design code. Design studies were made based off this initial design using the high fidelity Navier-Stokes solver OVERFLOW and FW-H solver PSU-WOPWOP. This process resulted in an increased solidity, reduced tip speed, and a swept anhedral blade tip. The final design was tested and shown to have a 3 dBA decreased OASPL at a hundred foot radius and 45 degrees below the propeller plane in hover when producing the same thrust as the previous propeller design. The newly designed blade has been flight tested on the Joby production prototype aircraft. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;9

Gearing an electrified aircraft's drivetrain generally leads to a lighter weight and/or more efficient drivetrain overall. Mechanical gears, however, due to their use of mechanical contact to transmit torque between gear bodies, have numerous wear and failure modes that lead to significant reliability and maintenance penalties. Magnetic gears, on the other hand, use magnetic fields instead of mechanical contact to transmit torque between gear bodies, and therefore have the potential to achieve the benefits of a geared drive system without reliability and maintenance penalties. Magnetic gears cannot match the specific torque of mechanical gears. Therefore simply trading a mechanical gear for a magnetic gear in a drive train will add mass. To make a magnetically-geared drive competitive with a mechanically geared drive in terms of mass, the magnetic gear and the electric motor in the drive train have to be integrated to share magnetic and mechanical components. One way of integrating a magnetic gear and a motor is called an outer stator magnetically-geared motor. In this paper, the outer stator magnetically-geared motor is assessed for its potential in urban air mobility vehicles. A design tool for outer stator magnetically-geared motors is developed. The tool is used to create a preliminary design of a 100 kW outer stator magnetically-geared motor. High fidelity analysis of that design is used to finalize it and update the design tool. Additional design tool results are produced to estimate the potential of the outer stator magnetically-geared motor for a 100 kW urban air mobility drive. 2020 AIAA.;9

We propose an online computational guidance algorithm for flight planning using Markov Decision Processes (MDP) that is capable of computing flight plans for resource constrained embedded computers found on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles which we anticipate will operate in UAS Traffic Management (UTM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) contexts. We propose a novel algorithm for efficiently solving a certain class of MDPs and show how UAV flight planning can be formulated within this framework. We show that as obstacles change dynamically, the algorithm can quickly compute new trajectories making it suitable for an online planner. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2019;D.+A.+Wachspress M.+K.+Yu K.+S.+Brentner;Rotor/Airframe Aeroacoustic Prediction For Evtol Uam Aircraft;A major innovative thrust in urban air mobility (UAM) is underway that will potentially transform how we travel by providing on-demand, affordable, quiet, and fast passenger-carrying operations in metropolitan areas using electric-powered vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. To support this, it is propitious to enhance existing VTOL aircraft analysis and design tools as necessary and provide these enhanced tools to entrepreneurs attempting to design this new breed of aircraft. In this regard, work was performed to enhance an existing VTOL aircraft aeroacoustics analysis with additional modeling capabilities useful for comprehensive acoustic prediction of Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) aircraft noise. The goal is to develop software that will provide fast, accurate prediction of acoustic characteristics associated with DEP aircraft, including (1) noise generated by the simultaneous operation of multiple, variable RPM lifting and propelling rotors and props, (2) interacting rotor/prop/duct/airframe noise, including strut noise and prop/wing interaction noise, (3) broadband noise characteristic of eVTOL configurations, and (4) electric motor noise. This paper describes initial work toward these goals that was performed to enhance and validate a fast method for predicting rotor/airframe noise for combinations of rotor, props, struts, ducts and wings.

While later in the book, dedicated chapters focus on individual systems, this chapter aims to provide an overall introduction to the topic. Traditional and emerging transportation systems, models, and modes are examined, as well as, innovations that may receive significant market share in the near future. The analysis revealed that the use of public transport is influenced primarily by service reliability, especially for persons commuting for work, while the use of taxis by driver professionalism, convenience of booking, and price. For shared mobility with its various forms and models (carsharing, ridehailing, bikesharing, etc.), comfort, cost savings, and time savings are the primary common factors that have the highest positive effect on service quality. Shared autonomous vehicles can further enhance the factors that encourage the use of shared mobility, despite the safety concerns expressed for this innovation. Finally, the future adoption of urban air mobility is expected to be influenced by time savings followed by convenience and service reliability. 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;9

Topology of these vehicles is yet not converged. Possible concepts can be divided into three classes: Multicopter concepts, Lift&Cruise concepts and TiltWing concepts. All concepts differ in their behavior and therefore in their energy efficiency. Current study aims to give a basis for a decision in a very early state of development for vehicle design. Therefore, a simulation tool AirCAD for preliminary design of electrically powered Vertical TakeOff and Landing aircraft (eVTOL) is developed. The tool is based on an aerodynamic module that uses blade element method for rotor analysis. The three different concepts are compared at equal vehicle sizes and at different design ranges. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;9

Traffic congestion in leading metro areas is increasing and leading to significant increases in commuting time and pollution. This leads to a renewed interest in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts of operations to improve efficiency and mitigate some of these concerns. Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft have been investigated extensively, but suffer from shortcomings related to rotor noise and overall vehicle energy efficiency. Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft present a unique capability to overcome some of these shortcomings, provided a viable concept of operations leading to tangible benefits to customers can be constructed. The objective of this research is to generate a parametric environment to analyze the door-to-door travel time for several origin and destination (O&D) pairs within an urban and suburban environment. Travel times are then compared for two modes of transportations: personal cars and a mix of ground ridesharing and air transportation using STOL aircraft. The sensitivity of the door-to-door travel time to airpark geo-density and various vehicle performance attributes is assessed to help derive requirements for future concepts of operations featuring STOL aircraft. Promising results are obtained and indicate that for these operations must target ground commutes in excess of 45 min and use vehicles able to take off from runways of 500ft while cruising at speeds over 160kts. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.1016/j.tra.2021.06.001;2021;R.+Merkert M.+J.+Beck J.+Bushell;Will It Fly? Adoption Of The Road Pricing Framework To Manage Drone Use Of Airspace;Applications and demand for airborne drone operations, including urban air mobility, are growing rapidly in regional and metropolitan areas. However, the expected traffic volumes in cities will make it impossible to operate drones in uncontrolled airspace. Despite the wealth of literature on pricing transport infrastructure usage showing that variable pricing is the optimal way for charging for road use, jurisdictions are reluctant to move towards this efficient mechanism evident in the slow uptake of road pricing implementation globally. What is worse, regulations have been drafted to tax the drone growth similarly to cars proposing the adoption of annual registration fees for drones. This paper proposes that drone use should instead adopt a pricing structure modelled on road user charging, and presents evidence suggesting that a case can be made for enabling controlled and fair growth through low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems and variable drone user charges. A stated preference experiment with 825 respondents who actively fly drones has shown user charge potential in way of willingness to pay (WTP) of A$0.11 for flying a drone for one hour. Random parameters logit models further allowed us to establish much higher WTP for various currently not permitted activities such as A$7.09 to fly beyond line of flight or A$4.29 to fly outside daylight hours. As such, if those occasional uses are variably charged, we argue that a commercially viable LAAM system could be implemented, and low altitude air traffic user charging could overtake implementation of the wider (i.e. road) transport capacity pricing on the fast lane. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;8
10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441631;2021;M.+Rimjha A.+Trani;Urban Air Mobility: Factors Affecting Vertiport Capacity;This study aims at analyzing critical factors impacting vertiport capacity in urban areas. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) or Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a concept transportation mode being designed for intracity transport of passengers and cargo utilizing autonomous electric vehicles capable of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) from dense and congested areas. The vertiports are expected to be placed on rooftops in Central Business Districts (CBD), limiting vertiports' size and suggesting high infrastructure costs. Therefore, vertiport capacity analysis is critical for an efficient UAM network as operations could be tailored for maximum efficiency. This analysis uses the vertiport designs developed for a previous study using current guidelines for heliports by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The minimum area of all designs was estimated for single and dual taxi-lanes configurations. From a preliminary geospatial analysis of San Francisco CBD, the rooftops' sizes are less likely to accommodate vertiports with more than three landing pads, even with tailored modifications. Therefore, this capacity analysis only considers vertiports with 1, 2, and 3 landing pads. A Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model is developed in MATLAB to simulate UAM operations and determine vertiport capacity. A high-demand vertiport in San Francisco Financial District is selected to understand the impact of unidirectional flows on a vertiport's passenger serving capacity. The analysis focuses on the utilization of various elements of vertiport, as they comprise the overall efficiency of the vertiport operations. Moreover, vertiport capacity sensitivity against elements such as the charging rate, service times at landing pads, and parking stalls are included in the findings. 2021 IEEE.;8

This paper builds upon the prior computational framework development to perform such analysis for two candidate metropolitan areas: Chicago and Dallas. As part of the larger study, various operational limits, including, high operating cost, aerodrome throughput capacity, weather, surface congestion, etc. are analyzed. In this work, daily commute trips are generated for each metropolitan area (6 million for Chicago and 5 million for Dallas), along with the income information to estimate the number of UAM-preferred trips for various network sizes. A number of metro-level sensitivity studies for specific aerodrome infrastructure, operating cost scenarios, and ride-sharing are reported. A summary of key findings from various concurrent studies is also provided to assist the UAM community in realizing this new mode of transportation. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056798;2021;G.+Pan M.+S.+Alouini;Flying Car Transportation System: Advances, Techniques, And Challenges;Since the development of transport systems, humans have exploited ground-level, below-ground, and high-altitude spaces for transportation purposes. However, with the increasing burden of expanding populations and rapid urbanization in recent decades, public transportation systems and freight traffic are suffering huge pressure, plaguing local governments and straining economies. Engineers and researchers have started to re-examine, propose, and develop the underused near-ground spaces (NGS) for transportation purposes. For instance, flying cars, which are not a totally novel idea, aim at solving the traffic congestion problem and releasing the strains on existing city transport networks by utilizing unoccupied NGS. Flying cars differ from traditional grounded transportation systems that are entirely limited by their physical space, such as trains on tracks or automobiles on roads. Flying cars do not occupy or compete for high-altitude spaces used by air traffic for long-distance transfer. As there is limited specific literature on flying cars and flying car transportation systems (FCTS), this paper aims to describe the modern advances, techniques, and challenges of FCTS. We explore the inherent nature of NGS transportation and devise useful proposals to facilitate the construction and commercialization of FCTS. We begin with an introduction to the increasing need for NGS transportation and we address the advantages of using flying cars. Next, we present a brief overview of the history of the development of flying cars in terms of the historic timeline and technique development. Then, we discuss and compare the state of the art in the design of flying cars, including the take-off landing (TOL) modes, pilot modes, operation modes, and power types, which are related to the adaptability, flexibility comfort, stability complexity, and environmental friendliness of flying cars, respectively. Additionally, since large-scale operations of flying cars can improve current transportation problems, we also introduce different facets of the various designs of FCTS, including path and trajectory planning, supporting facilities, and commercial designs. Finally, we discuss the challenges that might arise while developing and commercializing FCTS in terms of safety issues, commercial issues, and ethical issues. 2013 IEEE.;8
N/A;2021;S.+Geuther X.+Fei;La-8 Computational Analysis And Validation Studies Using Flightstream;With the emerging market of Urban Air Mobility and the associated unique new flight vehicles with the capability of vertical takeoff and landing, design tools need to be calibrated to assist in the development of these new flight vehicle concepts. Distributed electric propulsion (DEP) covers these vehicles with high-energy flow from the array of motors, which leads to extensive propulsion/airframe interaction effects. With limited experimental data of vehicles using DEP and vehicle operation across a large range of angles of attack, including post-stall conditions, there is a lack of validated design tools to advance new vehicle concepts that have blown wings and operate in multiple flight modes. Although some CFD tools can handle the integration of multiple propulsors and unique geometries, the computational time with a full vehicle is extraordinary. FlightStream, a surface vorticity flow solver that can run in a fraction of the time of other CFD methods, has been evaluated using the Langley Aerodrome No. 8 (LA-8) vehicle as a test case. The LA-8 vehicle is a DEP tandem tilt-wing research vehicle that was designed, built, and tested at NASA Langley Research Center. The LA-8 design features both high-performance and high-technical risks aspects. The vehicle has gone through extensive design of experiments wind tunnel testing in the NASA Langley 12-Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel in order to capture all modes of operation. In addition, the LA-8 vehicle has undergone wind tunnel testing with and without propellers, which contributes to the validation of FlightStream for aerodynamic performance in blown and unblown wing cases. This study shows that FlightStream can produce trends and magnitudes of the lift and drag coefficients similar to the data collected from the wind tunnel testing of LA-8. The test cases were both blown and unblown wing cases and with and without high lift control surface deflections. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These organizations have little training or experience in the traditional processes used in civil aviation for the development of software and electronic hardware. They are also constrained in the resources they can allocate for dedicated teams of professionals to follow these standardized processes. To fill this gap, this paper presents a custom workflow based on a subset of objectives derived from the foundational standards for safety critical software DO-178C/DO-331. The selection of objectives from the standards is based on the importance, degree of automation, and reusability of specific objectives. This custom workflow is intended to establish a lean and highly automated development life cycle resulting in higher quality software with better maintainability characteristics for research and prototype aircraft. It can also be proposed as means of compliance for software of certain applications such as unmanned aircraft systems, urban air mobility and general aviation. By producing the essential set of development and verification artifacts, the custom workflow also provides a scalable basis for potential future certification in compliance with DO-178C/DO-331. The custom workflow is demonstrated in a case study of an Autopilot Manual Disconnection System. 2020 IEEE.;8
10.3390/ROBOTICS9030066;2020;O.+K.+Isik J.+Hong I.+Petrunin A.+Tsourdos;Integrity Analysis For Gps-Based Navigation Of Uavs In Urban Environment;The increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in safety-critical missions in both civilian and military areas demands accurate and reliable navigation, where one of the key sources of navigation information is presented by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In challenging conditions, for example, in urban areas, the accuracy of GNSS-based navigation may degrade significantly due to user-satellite geometry and obscuration issues without being noticed by the user. Therefore, considering the essentially dynamic rate of change in this type of environment, integrity monitoring is of critical importance for understanding the level of trust we have in positioning and timing data. In this paper, the dilution of precision (DOP) coefficients under nominal and challenging conditions were investigated for the purpose of integrity monitoring in urban environments. By analyzing positioning information in a simulated urban environment using a software-based GNSS receiver, the integrity monitoring approach based on joint consideration of GNSS observables and environmental parameters has been proposed. It was shown that DOP coefficients, when considered together with a number of visible satellites and cut-off elevations specific to the urban environment carry valuable integrity information that is difficult to get using existing integrity monitoring approaches. This has allowed generating indirect integrity measures based on cut-off elevation and satellite visibility that can be used for UAV path planning and guidance in urban environments. 2020 by the authors.;8

However, advanced simulation tools still need to be developed to exploit the potentiality and address the complexity of these systems. The goal of this investigation is to propose a modeling approach for the degradation of the battery performance during its aging, and to use such model to quantify the fuel economy and operability of a hybrid electric helicopter both in normal AirTaxi operation and in the case of engine failure. The proposed method is based on experimental data for lithium batteries retrieved in the literature. The battery model is included in a comprehensive simulation tool where the turboshaft engine and the electric machine are simulated with a simple but thorough approach that takes into account the part-load behavior of both energy converters. The present investigation also proposes and compares different strategies for the use of the battery during the AirTaxi mission showing that it is possible to reduce fuel consumption up to 11% when the battery is at the beginning of its life. When the battery comes close to its end of life, it is necessary to use an energy management strategy which ensures a sustainment of its state of charge at the expenses of a lower fuel saving. 2020 by the authors.;8

The latter has been recently observed in the research community of urban air mobility (UAM). Research in this area has studied several areas of its implementation, such as vehicle concepts, infrastructure, transport modeling, or operational constraints. Few studies however have focused on evaluating this service as an alternative among existing transportation systems. This research presents an approach for the selection of indicators for a multi-criteria analysis for the assessment of UAM, in a case study of Upper Bavaria, Germany. A 5-stage approach is showcased including an expert assessment for the relevance and feasibility of indicators, based on two rating scales. A threshold for selection is presented, applied and validated for both scales. The results included a list of indicators for assessing the potentials of UAM integration to existing public transportation systems, the chosen indicators were then compared against existing ones for sustainable urban mobility. A high match between resulting indicators and previous ones further validate the results, and suggest that there is a need for an iterative approach in the assessment of disruptive transport technologies. 2020, TU Delft.

10.2514/1.D0183;2020;P.+D.+Vascik J.+Cho V.+Bulusu V.+Polishchuk;Geometric Approach Towards Airspace Assessment For Emerging Operations;Emerging urban air mobility operators propose to introduce extensive flight networks into metropolitan airspace. However, this airspace currently contains complex legacy airspace structure and flight operations that are perceived as safe, efficient, and generally acceptable to the overflown public. Hence, air traffic management concepts to support these emerging operators may be constrained to cause little to no interference with legacy operations. The identification of airspace that is noninterfering and potentially available to these new operators is therefore a critical first step toward their integration. This paper introduces a geometric airspace assessment approach that considers seven features of airspace that may preclude these new operations (that is, airspace constructs). Four hypothetical air traffic management scenarios are developed that prescribe different degrees of integration. An alpha-shape topological method is refined to process geometrically complex airspace construct polygons over an expansive geographic area and develop three-dimensional mappings of airspace availability. The approach is demonstrated in the San Francisco Bay Area and is readily extensible to other locations. It is envisioned to be useful in identification of viable takeoff and landing sites, evaluation of the sensitivity of airspace availability to separation or trajectory conformance requirements, and flight route design, throughput estimation, and risk analysis. 2020by Vishwanath Bulusu, Parker Vascik, Valentin Polishchuk, and Jungwoo Cho.;8

From the first steps whereas aviation 1.0 can be defined as the period between the first powered flight (1903) and the advent of the first commercial airliner that was operated on a scheduled international route, the Airco DH.16 (1919) between London and Paris, humanity has faced with the (r)evolution which goes by the many names of flying cars, air taxis, personal air vehicles (PAVs), electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOLs) vehicles, and finally, Urban Air Mobility. Therefore, the concept of safety and its evolution has been changed for many times. Those changes are influenced by different approaches which roughly align with eras of activities in the aviation science and practice. Main approaches, by the time of occurrence, are: technical era (from early 1900s until late 1960s), human factors era (from early 1970s), organizational era (from mid 1990s) and total system era (from the beginning of the 21st century). Compounding evolution of technology and development in aviation industry and safety treats and aspects, this paper provides overall analysis of creating dominant safety management principles in aviation industry. Moreover, paper considers aircraft accidents caused by flight crew errors since it could be the main problem in urban air mobility safety issues. The final part is dedicated to the States role in performing aviation safety and challenges they are faced with. The purpose of the paper is to provide comprehensive platform for safety analysis within the new concept of urban air mobility. 2020 The Author(s).;8

As Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are being developed, we need new encounter models that are representative of their operational environment. Developing such models is challenging due to the lack of data on UAM behavior in the airspace. While previous encounter models for other aircraft types rely on large datasets to produce realistic trajectories, this paper presents an approach to encounter modeling that instead relies on expert knowledge. In particular, recent advances in preference-based learning are extended to tune an encounter model from expert preferences. The model takes the form of a stochastic policy for a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the reward function is learned from pairwise queries of a domain expert. We evaluate the performance of two querying methods that seek to maximize the information obtained from each query. Ultimately, we demonstrate a method for generating realistic encounter trajectories with only a few minutes of an expert's time. 2019 IEEE.;8

Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft offer new possibilities for Urban Air Mobility (UAM). However, these developments will create operational issues and safety concerns, especially in the socalled transition period when these aircraft are expected to be manned by pilots, and assisted by onboard automation systems. In this transition period, different aircraft will have different systems for flying. Additionally, the type of flight control used during take-off and landing will often be different from the type of control used en route. In contrast to pilots on large commercial aircraft, eVTOL pilots will have available greater levels of automation, but will also incur greater variability in the type and scope of human control. How will this interaction between pilots and automation impact the safety of flight, especially in cases where the automation systems fail, and the pilot must assume full control? This paper explores the risks associated with manned eVTOLs, and the impact of automation system failures on pilot workload and flight safety by using Bayesian Belief Network. 2019 IEEE.;8

To answer this question, we provide a Life Cycle Assessment of three electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing concept aircraft, including a quantification of uncertainties in the concepts material composition. We conduct a Cradle-to-Gate analysis of the concepts and extend it by a Well-to-Shaft analysis of Urban Air Mobility operation, including all relevant upstream greenhouse gas emissions due to battery use, again including input uncertainties. As for aviation systems in general, we show that the impact of power demand in operation is most significant and exceeds emissions from production by orders of magnitude. We thus provide sensitivity analyses of the results for each of the most influential quantities. We report an optimum flight speed for minimum greenhouse gas emissions and a quantification of the impact of hover flight. Finally, we compare and quantify the impacts sensitivities on influential factors like the region of operation, and mission design within reasonable ranges. From the sensitivity analyses, we conclude that only very lightweight vehicles for Urban Air Mobility can be more sustainable than traditional, fossil-fueled ground-based transportation, given a maximum seat utilization, clean power grid, low hover share and an effective reduction in travel distance. We further conclude that, with a combination of the most optimistic assumptions, Urban Air Mobility concepts may environmentally compete with battery-powered cars. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-0530;2019;C.+Y.+Justin D.+N.+Mavris;Environment Impact On Feasibility Of Sub-Urban Air Mobility Using Stol Vehicles;Increasing urban sprawl and increasing population around the globe exacerbate urban and suburban mobility challenges. Traffic congestion in and around urban centers slows commutes and has led to a renewed interest in Urban and Sub-Urban Air Mobility (SUAM). These operations aims at reducing commuting time by flying over road traffic. Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft have been investigated extensively for these operations, but suffer from shortcomings related to rotor noise and overall vehicle efficiency. Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft present a unique capability to overcome some of these shortcomings but may be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, and in particular to wind. This research builds upon previous efforts aimed at assessing the viability of STOL-based SUAM operations by investigating the geodensity of a network of airparks. The objective of this research is to review the best design practices for airparks and in particular to account for environmental considerations. First, historical weather observations are analyzed to identify prevailing winds within the South Florida conurbation. This is subsequently used to identify preferred runway directions or preferred combinations of runway directions. Suitable airpark locations are then identified by analyzing cadastre and land-use data. Finally, suitable airpark locations and favorable runway directions are combined to position runways within vacant land parcels and to assess their maximum lengths. This yields an estimate of the geodensity of airparks for different runway lengths. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;8

The approach leverages a simple aircraft performance model of sufficient abstraction to be suitable for a wide range of potential eVTOL configurations including lift plus cruise, quadcopter, and side-by-side helicopter configurations. Using this performance model, we examine sizing and performance of a presumed UAM network in the greater San Francisco area. The output from this model is used to determine the optimal size of the aircraft with respect to factors such as the number of flights completed and profitability. The optimal weight for maximizing the number of completed routes can be determined analytically and is the weight at which both the charger power and the allowable charge C-rate are maximized unless the aircraft must be larger to fly the sizing mission. The profitability is also determined analytically and follows trends similar to the optimal weight for routes completed. Finally, we explore sensitivities of profitability and routes completed to changes in specific energy, charger power, and charge C-rate. Increasing specific energy always increases profitability while charger power and charge C-rate must be increased together. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-1218;2019;T.+H.+Ha K.+Lee J.+T.+Hwang;Large-Scale Design And Economics Optimization Of Evtol Concepts For Urban Air Mobility;Urban air mobility is receiving considerable attention for its transformative potential in enabling point-to-point air travel in congested cities. Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) concepts are well-suited for this application because of its synergistic benefits in terms of safety, reliability, efficiency, and noise. In assessing profitability, it is important to consider both the performance and operational aspects because the design and economics are coupled, as both are strongly affected by the cruise airspeed. In this paper, we present methods for large-scale optimization of the design and operation of eVTOL concepts for urban air mobility. We integrate a system-level multidisciplinary model of the aircraft performance with a network-flow based model of the operational profile of the eVTOL concept in a target market. We maximize profit with respect to aircraft design variables, the cruise airspeeds on each route in the market, and the optimal route allocation variablesin total, there are 1063 variables in the optimization problem. We demonstrate this approach using concepts based on A3 by Airbus Vahana and Kitty Hawks Cora, and find an 11% improvement in profit by optimizing with the aircraft design and economics considered simultaneously. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Several changes on aircraft propulsion will occur in the next 30 years, following the aircraft market demand and environmental regulations. Two commercial areas are in evolution, electrical urban air mobility (UAM) and hybrid-electric regional aircraft. The first one is expected to come into service in the next 10 years with small devices. The last one will gradually come into service, starting with small aircraft according to developments in energy storage, fuel cells, aircraft design and hybrid architectures integration. All-electric architecture seems to be more adapted to UAM. Turbo-electric hybrid architecture combined with distributed propulsion and boundary layer ingestion seems to have more success for regional aircraft, attaining environmental goals for 2030 and 2050. Computational models supported by powerful simulation tools will be a key to support research and aircraft HEP design in the coming years. Brazilian research in these challenging areas is in the beginning, and a multidisciplinary collaboration will be critical for success in the next few years. 2021, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.;7

Airport ground access trips could be among the early adopters of UAM because of the high customer willingness to pay, and substantial time-savings for long-distance or significantly congested access trips. This study aims to estimate demand for UAM in the airport ground access segment of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Travel behavior is derived from the airport passenger survey 2019 provided by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA). A mixed logit model captures the mode-choice behavior that is later modified to include UAM. Total daily originating passenger trips are estimated from the T-100 database. The calibrated model is then applied to calculate the UAM demand. Utilizing the developed UAM demand estimation framework, a feasibility analysis is performed through a series of sensitivity analyses with respect to UAM passenger cost per mile (CPM) and UAM network size (number of vertiports). Furthermore, the Also, UAM demand in specific high-demand corridors (according to the ground access traffic) is analyzed. UAM could capture an estimated 3.6% market share in airport access trips to/from LAX at $2.00 UAM cost per passenger mile, assuming 2.4 passengers per flight (additional to $15 base cost per passenger and $20 landing cost per flight). 2021 IEEE.;7

Research continues to provide applications of various siting formulations and methodologies using metropolitan areas such as San Francisco, Miami, Los Angeles, and Boston, however, there is limited work on siting approaches that investigate the impact of siting on passenger mode choice for a given metropolitan area. This paper investigates the impact of UAM-aerodrome siting on mode choice via trip effective cost modeling. The resulting optimal UAM-aerodrome networks undergo evaluation using a computational analysis framework to assess the number of UAM-preferred trips and provide guidance on siting UAM-aerodromes in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. The developed siting analysis generated multiple networks using various features, and the authors observed moderate improvements in the number of UAM-preferred trips as a result of marginal improvements in generated objective values. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

N/A;2021;S.+Withrow-Maser C.+Malpica K.+Nagami;Impact Of Handling Qualities On Motor Sizing For Multirotor Aircraft With Urban Air Mobility Missions;Control models of three NASA Urban Air Mobility (UAM) reference vehicles (the quadrotor, octocopter, and Lift+Cruise (LPC)) were created and compared to determine the effect of rotor number and disk loading on control margin and design. The heave and yaw axes demand more actuator usage than the roll and pitch axes. Between heave and yaw, heave was the more demanding of the two because of the dependence of heave on the engine speed controller (ESC). When the feedback gains for all three vehicles were optimized to Level 1 handling qualities (HQs) specifications using CONDUIT, the ESC for the octocopter was the most stable and had the highest rise time (time for the rotor to respond to an input), while the LPC ESC was the least stable and had the smallest rise time. Rise time corresponds to the time required for rotor response. When actuator usage was translated to current margin, torque margin, and power margin, heave was the most demanding axis, followed by yaw, roll, and then pitch for all three vehicles. The results emphasize the importance of an accurate motor model within the control system architecture. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;7
N/A;2021;J.+W.+Cook J.+Hauser;A Strip Theory Approach To Dynamic Modeling Of Tiltwing Evtol Aircraft;The proliferation of electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft designs destined for the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market has led to a need for dynamic modeling tools capable of capturing the unique aspects of their flight envelope including hover, transition, and cruise operations. This paper describes a modeling approach for the tiltwing class of eVTOL aircraft. The approach builds the aircraft by component allowing for rapid model generation of many different configurations, including variations of wing size and placement, number of propellers distributed along the wing, as well as tilting and non-tilting tails with or without attached propellers. Interactions between the wing and propellers are captured using momentum theory to approximate the flow as seen by the wing. Dynamic effects, as well as differential thrust and deflecting surfaces are taken into account by employing strip theory in which the aerodynamic surfaces are divided into smaller strips with contributions that can be summed to capture moments generated by non-symmetric flow. The resulting aero-propulsive aircraft model sufficiently captures the unique capabilities of the transition aircraft and can be used in dynamic simulation for initial flight envelope investigation and control design. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2021-1644;2021;P.+C.+Murphy B.+M.+Simmons D.+B.+Hatke R.+C.+Busan;Rapid Aero Modeling For Urban Air Mobility Aircraft In Wind-Tunnel Tests;Rapid Aero Modeling (RAM) applied to wind tunnel testing, RAM-T, is an approach to efficiently and automatically obtain aerodynamic models during testing. The approach saves time and resources by responding to the demand for experimental efficiency and model fidelity. Motivation for this demand is more acute when investigating a class of vehicles categorized as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft where many features from both aircraft and rotorcraft are present. RAM-T provides a feedback loop around the test facility to guide the test toward high-fidelity, statistically rigorous aircraft models. The general RAM approach is applicable to computational or physical experiments. It combines concepts from design of experiment theory and aircraft system identification theory that allow the user the freedom to choose, in advance of the test, a specific level of fidelity in terms of prediction error. RAM only collects data required to meet the user-specified fidelity and fidelity is only limited by the facility and test article capabilities. This paper presents results from tests conducted for development of an automated RAM-T technology. The results highlight some of the unique features of RAM applied to eVTOL configurations. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;7
N/A;2021;D.+Dollinger P.+F.+Reiss J.+Angelov D.+Loebl F.+Holzapfel;Control Inceptor Design For Onboard Piloted Transition Vtol Aircraft Considering Simplified Vehicle Operation;The central element for operating or piloting an aircraft is its Human-Machine-Interface (HMI). To efficiently interact with the flight control system, the HMI and especially its control inceptors are highly adapted to the vehicles configuration and its flight control systems degree of automation. In Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts, VTOL transition vehicles emerge while combining beneficial characteristics of two underlying aircraft configurations. In this paper, a HMI concept comprising novel control inceptor designs for transition VTOL aircraft, is proposed. Together with the implemented flight control system, Simplified Vehicle Operation (SVO) shall ensure intuitive and unified control behavior across the whole flight envelope. Considering future certification aspects of such a system, the actual Handling Qualities (HQ) are evaluated and compared against Minimum Acceptable Handling Qualities Rating (MAHQR) published by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). These MAHQR need to be achieved for demonstrating compliance to EASAs SC-VTOL, the regulatory framework for certification of VTOL aircraft. Pilot-in-the-Loop (PIL) experiments are conducted in a simulative environment to determine the actual HQ with Cooper-Harper Rating (CHR). A UAM example mission containing all flight phases of a transition VTOL aircraft is the PIL experiments basis. The results show that the overall SVO concept, including flight control system and HMI, would meet the proposed MAHQR and enables also participants without classical piloting skills to operate a transition VTOL aircraft in a satisfactory manner. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Hence, a new increasingly autonomous Decision Support System (DSS) specifically designed for integrated manned/UAS Traffic Management (UTM) is of paramount importance. This DSS makes use of advanced traffic flow and airspace management concepts, but to ensure effective teaming between the human and the system in challenging situations, the nature of their roles and responsibilities is to be analysed in depth and reflected in the design of suitable Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (HMI2). The task analysis presented in this paper assessed the interdependencies between the human and the machine following the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) framework. The paper focuses on the management of urban airspace, which is partitioned based on navigation performance. The human-machine workflow is presented and discussed, highlighting the proposed interactions in each subtask. To support closed-loop interactions and enhance system integrity, the UTM DSS makes use of the Cognitive HMI2 concept, which is also briefly outlined in this paper. 2020 IEEE.;7

Unlike traditional human-in-the-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online. Instead, we develop L2F, a two-stage collision avoidance method that consists of: 1) a learning-based decision-making scheme and 2) a distributed, linear programming-based UAS control algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we show the real-time applicability of our method which is  6000 faster than the MILP approach and can resolve 100% of collisions when there is ample room to maneuver, and shows graceful degradation in performance otherwise. We also compare L2F to two other methods and demonstrate an implementation on quad-rotor robots. 2020 IEEE.;7

A nationwide framework of UAM traffic management for the near future was proposed. The UAM traffic management issues based on the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft were divided into three aspects for discussion (airspace planning, ground infrastructure, traffic rules and operation control). The representative views put forward by related literatures of UAM traffic management in the past few years were sorted out. The key issues that UAM needs to solve in the near future were summarized, and the development trend of UAM traffic management in the future was prospected. Research result shows that in terms of airspace planning, the UAM needs more refined planning and management of existing low-altitude uncontrolled airspace. The structured airspace demarcation method should be applied in the initial stage of UAM traffic management. The contradiction between the operational safety and airspace capacity can be better balanced by the flight layer airspace structure. In terms of ground infrastructure, the UAM traffic demand predicted by the urban OD data can be used for the location selection of vertiports. Also, the vertiport site management will directly affect the structure of the air route network and the layout of communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) stations. In terms of traffic rules and operation control, more complex UAVs and manned aircraft integration operation scenarios will be directly faced by the UAM. The UAM traffic rules need to be innovated and compatible with the existing transportation aviation traffic rules. High-band width communication technology will promote the transformation of the UAM operation control to the direction of air-ground coordinated decision-making and self-pilot. How to deal with the relationship between human and air traffic control system is very important to the future air traffic management. In general, UAM traffic management will likely intersect and gradually integrate with the existing UAS traffic management system. Facing this new mode of transportation, our country will be more likely to adopt the traffic management development route of centralized management, pilot operation, and orderly deregulation. 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

N/A;2020;C.+Johnson J.+Sirohi;Experimental Measurements And Low-Order Modeling Of Stacked Rotor Performance In Hover;Coaxial, co-rotating (stacked) rotors have been shown in the past to increase performance and decrease noise. Due to renewed interest in Urban Air Mobility, research of stacked rotors has increased. This paper reports an experimental study of 1.108 m-radii fixed-pitch stacked rotor with variable axial and azimuthal spacing performed to quantify effects of rotor geometry on total and individual rotor performance. Compared to a conventional, four-bladed rotor, figure of merit was found to increase by 6.4% at small axial spacings. A new rotor concept using azimuthal variation for thrust control was validated. It was observed that total thrust can be varied up to 17% through an azimuthal spacing change of 22.5. Additionally, a low-order model code, Blade Interaction Prediction (BLIP), was developed to efficiently predict the thrust of closely-spaced rotor blades. BLIP couples vortex element method and blade element momentum theory to combine the effects of chord-wise circulation and rotor inflow. Excellent correlation was observed with experimental results and it was found that small azimuthal angles are most effective to vary total thrust. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;7
N/A;2020;Z.+Jia S.+Lee;Aeroacoustic Analysis Of A Side-By-Side Hybrid Vtol Aircraft;This paper investigates the acoustics of a side-by-side Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft with 0%, 5%, 15%, and 25% rotor overlaps in forward flight based on high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The CFD and acoustics simulations are carried out using the HPCMP CREATETM-AV rotorcraft simulation and analysis tool Helios and the acoustic prediction tool PSU-WOPWOP. The influence of the finest wake-grid spacing size on acoustic prediction of the side-by-side rotor with 0% overlap is studied based on two wake-grid spacing cases: 5% Ctip and 10% Ctip. No significant difference in overall sound pressure level (OASPL) is found between the two cases. The effect of rotor overlap on rotor acoustics is also assessed, and it is shown that the 25% overlap case yields higher OASPL than the other overlap cases particularly due to stronger rotor-to-rotor blade-vortex interactions (BVIs). Furthermore, the noise of the side-by-side rotor with 0% and 25% overlaps is compared against similar-sized helicopter noise and various background noise levels. It is shown that the side-by-side rotor noise is comparable with the noise of a similar-sized four-bladed helicopter in cruise. The OASPL difference of the overhead case is less than 10 dB, which does not meet the guideline that the UAM noise should be 15 dB lower than similar-sized helicopter noise. The results also show that the side-by-side rotor noise could not be fully masked by the freeway background noise at an altitude of 1,500 ft. Thus, noise reduction technology should be developed to overcome the barrier of public acceptance of UAM noise. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;7
10.2514/6.2020-2906;2020;S.+A.+M.+Shihab P.+Wei J.+Shi N.+Yu;Optimal Evtol Fleet Dispatch For Urban Air Mobility And Power Grid Services;Fuel cost has always been the highest contributor to operating cost for airlines. In the context of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), for a company providing aerial ridesharing services, the cost of electric energy it consumes from the power grid will be the dominating cost factor. Unlike fuel, the electricity market is highly dynamic in terms of pricing and incentives. It often provides considerable amount of monetary compensation for consumers to help balance generation and load in the power system. In this work, we develop an optimal fleet dispatch framework for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to transport passengers and provide power grid services either separately or together. In addition to vehicle dispatching, the framework can also optimally price passenger trips taking place at different routes at different times. The eVTOL vehicle fleet operations was subjected to two sources of uncertainties, which are the pricing/incentive stochasticity from the dynamic electricity market, and the passenger demand uncertainty due to the stochastic trip requests. We investigate the trade-off among multiple revenue and cost sources for eVTOL fleet operations. The major objectives of this work include: (1) maximizing the first revenue source generated from transporting passengers, (2) maximizing the second revenue source generated from providing frequency regulation services to the power grid, and (3) reducing the operating and charging costs. The major benefits of this work include: (1) maximizing the revenue from eVTOL fleet operation, which will result in a more profitable aerial ride sharing company, (2) lowering the riding cost for passengers, which will make the aerial ride sharing more affordable to customers, and (3) enhancing the reliability and stability of modern smart grid. The results demonstrate that UAM carriers can earn more profit by dispatching the eVTOL fleet to provide both UAM travel and power grid services simultaneously than providing only one of the services. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2020-3256;2020;M.+Fu A.+Straubinger J.+Schaumeier;Scenario-Based Demand Assessment Of Urban Air Mobility In The Greater Munich Area;As traffic levels increase in urban agglomerations, opinions are voiced that wish to elevate urban transport into the third dimension, the air. In this work, we project the idea of aerial passenger transport into the near future: on-demand urban air mobility (UAM) for the greater Munich area in the year 2030. To date, most research is focusing on independent factors regarding the supply and demand of UAM, such as vehicle types and infrastructure capacity. We propose a simulation framework that facilitates analyzing the potential demand of UAM, using a combination of interacting factors. We define five scenarios, ranging from representations of niche application up to mass transport options, by varying fleet size, available technologies, infrastructure placement and pricing strategies. These scenarios are fed into an extended version of the agent-based transport simulation platform MATSim, chained with the microscopic transportation orchestrator (MITO). The simulation results show that the system configuration has a big impact on UAM demand, infrastructure capacity and fleet size were identified as main bottlenecks. We see high levels of demand during peak hours and for trips up to 20 km, however, none of the scenarios results in a sufficiently high modal share of UAM that manages to reduce traffic volumes substantially, and with that congestion, of ground-based modes. When aiming for an effective and sustainable UAM service, our recommendation is to, firstly, use it to support and improve, rather than cannibalize, existing public transport options, and second, minimize negative impacts on environment and society to maximize public acceptance. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081710;2019;S.+Siewert K.+Sampigethaya J.+Buchholz S.+Rizor;Fail-Safe, Fail-Secure Experiments For Small Uas And Uam Traffic In Urban Airspace;Millions of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), or drones weighing less than 55 pounds, will fly in urban airspaces within a decade. This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research. 2019 IEEE.;7

Unconventional geometric configurations, novel electric or hybrid-electric propulsion system architectures, distributed electric propulsion, transition between vertical and forward flight modes, and significantly greater aero-propulsive interactions feature prominently in these concepts. While the majority of research into such vehicles is currently geared towards sizing, feasibility/viability, and technology trade studies, the above-mentioned novel attributes imply that stability, control authority, flight characteristics, and pilot-friendliness will also be drivers for such designs. Thus, there is a clear need to develop modeling and simulation capabilities catering to the design and analysis requirements of these concepts. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a MATLAB/Simulink-based modeling and simulation framework that enables (i) simulation of six degrees-of-freedom vehicle flight dynamics, (ii) modeling and simulation of dynamics of propulsion, energy, and control actuation systems, (iii) convenient interfacing with aero-propulsive databases generated using other tools, (iv) implementation and testing of flight control algorithms, and (v) visual rendering with FlightGear and integration with control inceptors and display hardware for real-time human-in-the-loop simulations with pilots/operators.

The aircraft can be configured to carry a pilot and either three passengers or one passenger with a medical litter. A distributed electric propulsion (DEP) architecture is used, which facilitates wing blowing. Two outboard cruise propulsors near the wing tips continually operate, while eight inboard blowing propulsors provide burst power during takeoff, obstacle clearance, and landing. Power is provided by a varying combination of battery and turboshaft power. The MTOW is 2777 lb, the wing span is 37.1 ft, and the cruise L/D is 13.8. The takeoff and landing ground roll is 80 ft, and the cruise range is 100 nmi at 133 kts with a 30 min reserve. The cruise range can be extended up to 708 nmi when carrying only a pilot. This STOL aircraft offers a more-readily certifiable solution to the urban air mobility (UAM) design mission than eVTOL aircraft by not relying on battery power nor a fly-by-wire control system. Additionally, the design achieves an unblown stall speed of 49 kts and has glide capability. A geometric programming based sizing tool, GPkit, was used for aircraft sizing and optimization. A vortex lattice aerodynamic tool, JVL, was used for blown lift, controls, and stability analysis. 2019 by German Aerospace Center (DLR).

But what characteristics does UAM need to offer in order to represent successfully an extension to our traditional (public) transportation system and to fit into the concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) where various modes of transportation are bundled and accessible on demand? On the one hand, the supporting ground infrastructure specialized in accommodating UAM and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations, in this research named vertidrome, and on the other hand a consortium of stakeholders (vehicle operator, vertidrome operator, air traffic management, passenger, city councils, etc.) will determine a considerable portion of these requirements. The vertidrome is a UAM traffic junction, which merges airside and landside operations and interactions between the vertidrome infrastructure components, the vehicles and the passengers. This research work focuses on the exemplary development of a vertidromes airside operation considering a UAM application at the Munich trade fair (Germany). Following this objective, we analyze the unique characteristics of UAM, review the current state of the art regarding UAM ground infrastructure designs and introduce a new and VTOL-specific terminology vertidrome. In addition, we define an exemplary vertidrome concept of operations: a linear and expandable drive-through (LIEDT) topology, distinct approach and departure mission profiles based on the VTOL vehicle Volocopter 2X, as well as operating (airside air) and traffic (airside ground) rules for arriving and departing vehicles. The results will contribute to the development of a corresponding discrete event-based simulation (DES) depicting the elaborated vertidrome's airside structure and operations followed by the development of a performance assessment method evaluating a vertidrome's airside traffic flow (Vertidrome Airside Level of Service - VALoS). 2021 The Authors;6

These can be of great help particularly when designing distributed-electric-propulsion configurations, as they provide an agile tool that avoids the need for computationally expensive CFD/CAA predictions. Without losing the generality of the conclusions that can be drawn about the capability of the proposed surrogate models to accurately describe multi-propeller aerodynamic and aeroacoustic responses, applications to a single propeller configuration are presented. Focusing on the simulation of the effects due to the spanwise distribution of blade twist and chord length, two surrogate modelling techniques are examined: one based on Artificial Neural Networks and one based on Genetic Programming. The numerical database for the identification of these models is determined by the combined application of a boundary integral formulation suitable for the potential aerodynamics solution around lifting/thrusting bodies, and the Farassat 1A formulation for the evaluation of the noise field. The numerical investigation demonstrates that both metamodelling techniques are able to reproduce propeller aerodynamic performance and radiated noise with a very good level of accuracy, certainly suitable for preliminary design applications. 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS;6

10.1016/j.trc.2021.103324;2021;H.+Tang Y.+Zhang V.+Mohmoodian H.+Charkhgard;Automated Flight Planning Of High-Density Urban Air Mobility;Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is an emerging concept for transporting people and cargo in urban, rural, regional, and interregional settings using revolutionary new aircraft. Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a part of AAM, focused on transport passengers in low-altitude urban airspace, has attracted extensive attention among industry, government, academia, and the public. Compared to existing commercial flights, AAM operations are expected to be at higher density, thus, an AAM system needs to be scalable, safe, and autonomous. Third-party service providers are recommended for offering air traffic management and information sharing services given the anticipated high density of UAM operations. To this end, we propose an Automated Flight Planning System (AFPS) that could be employed by such service providers. In the AFPS, a Low-Altitude Airspace Management System (LAMS) is proposed to automatically generate a route network with the capability of avoiding obstacles and obstructions in low-altitude airspace. The main components of this tool are the generation of a 3D map with LiDAR data, construction of a nodal network based on the map by using the visibility graph method, and initiation of 3D shortest paths. Given the requests of flight operations, i.e., origin, destination, departure time, the Low-Altitude Traffic Management System (LTMS) will design pre-departure conflict-free 4D trajectories and provide flexibilities of en-route maneuvering by taking system cost and equity among operators into consideration. In this study, a flight-level assignment strategy is proposed to solve the trajectory deconfliction problem in LTMS. In addition, a Nash Social Welfare Program (NSWP) is introduced to maintain fairness among different operators if the service is provided to multiple operators of UAM. A case study of the Tampa Bay area in Florida is used to demonstrate the operability of the proposed AFPS, and animations are built to visualize the optimized conflict-free operations of UAM in the study area. 2021 The Authors;6
10.1016/j.ast.2021.106903;2021;M.+Wang J.+Diepolder S.+Zhang M.+Spper F.+Holzapfel;Trajectory Optimization-Based Maneuverability Assessment Of Evtol Aircraft;The emerging electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL) aircraft promotes the convenient urban air mobility, but the maneuverability of the eVTOL has not gained equivalent attention as the endurance problem or control law design. The maneuverability is actually critical for hover and low-speed phases to perform efficient and safe flights. However, the existing assessment paradigms of the maneuverability are not applicable to eVTOL due to the diversity of the configurations, new features of the distributed electric propulsion, and insufficient empirical data. This paper proposes an optimization-based method for maneuverability assessment as an alternative to the piloted experiment approach. The methodology uses trajectory optimization to determine the achievable performance regarding specific tasks. The optimization results yield an attainable maneuverability zone (AMZ), which is essentially a four-dimensional space that reflects the maneuverability of the eVTOL. The AMZ of the exemplary eVTOL has an approximately ellipsoidal shape with the weak-spot maneuverability in the backward-upward direction. The quantitative maneuverability measure is further used in the design optimization of the propeller layout and determination of the worst-case performance by a bi-level optimization framework. The proposed method enables efficient maneuverability evaluation and provides a model-based analysis of aircraft design quality. 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS;6

In the framework of tactical conflict management, i.e., with the UAVs in flight, this paper presents PCAN (Prediction-based Conflict-free Adaptive Navigation). This relatively simple navigation technique predicts the occurrence of the conflict and avoids it by modifying the velocity vector of the UAVs involved. The performance evaluation carried out demonstrates its effectiveness compared to similar techniques, even in high-density scenarios, while proving a low overhead in flight time or in the distance traveled by the UAVs to reach their destinations. 2021 by the authors.

10.1016/j.ast.2021.106621;2021;S.+Snyder P.+Zhao N.+Hovakimyan;Adaptive Control For Linear Parameter-Varying Systems With Application To A Vtol Aircraft;As a systematic method for gain-scheduling, the linear parameter-varying (LPV) system framework has been widely used for the design of aerospace control systems with large operating envelopes. This paper presents design and analysis of an adaptive control architecture for LPV systems subject to time-varying parametric uncertainties and external disturbances, with both transient and steady-state performance guarantees. We introduce new tools relying on parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and linear matrix inequality techniques for stability and performance analysis. These tools  limited to linear systems  potentially yield less conservative results than the approach employed for this architecture in previous adaptive control literature based on the small-gain theorem. The transient and steady-state performance of the adaptive closed-loop system, in terms of input and output signals, is quantified with respect to a non-adaptive reference system that depends on the true values of the uncertainties and represents the best achievable performance. It is shown that the transient performance bounds can be made arbitrarily small in the case of zero initialization error for the state predictor and will include additional exponentially decaying terms in the presence of non-zero initialization error. The approach can be used to design an adaptive augmentation of a baseline LPV control system. A simulation example of the longitudinal dynamics of a conceptual Urban Air Mobility aircraft is used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. 2021;6

To address the environmental challenges, the proposed concepts are either hybrid-electric or all-electric vehicles enabled with propellers that rotate at lower speeds than conventional rotorcraft configurations, such as helicopters. However, the feasibility of UAM in the near future requires significant progress on the all-electric propulsion systems since current battery technology still falls short when compared with fossil fuel in terms of specific energy density. In this work, a methodology is proposed to evaluate the environmental footprint of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft for the UAM market. This methodology is applied to existing concepts for exploratory studies on mission critical performance and environmental parameters. All-electric aircraft were found to be feasible for the UAM segment from the performance perspective. However, further improvements in battery technology and electricity generation from renewable sources are required. Sustainable aviation fuels, such as Alcohol-To-Jet (ATJ) obtained from wheat straw, present a substantially lower environmental impact than conventional fuels while providing the same performance. These biofuels also contribute less to global warming and climate changes than batteries which: (i) are recharged from electric grids still dependable on non-renewable sources, and (ii) have a low number of rechargedischarge cycles. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;6

Several researches so far are focused on individual vehicle architectures such as multirotor or tiltrotor etc., but not much effort in a System of Systems (SoS) point of view where a homogenous fleet of vehicle with different passenger capacity, speed, and propulsive energy concepts are assessed in a framework for a successful UAM operations in a given city. An effort is made in this paper wherein, vehicle architecture is derived from the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) of scenarios such as urban and suburban operations and as well as propulsion subsystem for sustainable UAM. This paper approaches UAM aircraft design driven by SoS approach and an agent-based simulation supports the vehicle architecture evaluation and fleet definition. The outcome of this study is: Multiple aircraft design with subsystem architectures, ideal fleet size for the respective operational scenarios, autonomy and battery technology effectiveness on UAM throughput (to efficiently provide UAM on-demand service maximum passengers within 15 min wait time), and importantly, sustainability metrics such as total fleet energy required. Several System of Systems, system and subsystem level sensitivity research questions are addressed to understand the interlevel coupling. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2021-3201;2021;K.+Schweiger F.+Knabe B.+Korn;Urban Air Mobility: Vertidrome Airside Level Of Service Concept;The vertidrome, a ground infrastructure supporting vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) operations, is one of the key elements of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). It accommodates UAM airside and landside operations and may provide connection to other transportation modes. A vertidromes processing performance needs to be predictable and reliable in order to plan and execute satisfactorily passenger and cargo UAM transportation requests with respect to all stakeholders involved. Therefore, we propose a new performance assessment concept to predict and evaluate the performance of a vertidromes airside traffic flow with respect to specific stakeholder requirements, here defined as the passenger, the VTOL-vehicle operator and the vertidrome operator. Based on their individual objectives, each stakeholder defines a specific performance indicator, which in this paper is including but not limited to delay and punctuality. The proposed Vertidrome Airside Level of Service Concept (VALoS) is based on existent performance rating methods (level of service) for highway traffic and airport terminal facilities. After adjusting the level of service paradigm to UAM specifics, a new framework is proposed considering a vertidromes airside operation. Furthermore, the applicability of the VALoS framework is demonstrated. For this purpose, two exemplary use cases are defined considering a vertidrome layout change (reduction of gate parking positions) and an off-nominal condition causing deviations from the schedule (deviations of flight time/ gate service time). 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

N/A;2021;S.+Li S.+Lee;Acoustics Analysis Of A Quiet Helicopter For Air Taxi Operations;This paper investigates tonal noise and broadband noise for rotor designs used on urban air mobility vehicles. The rotor aerodynamics in edge-wise forward flight is calculated using the blade element theory, coupled with a dynamic inflow model and the moment-balance trim analysis. Loading noise and thickness noise are obtained using the lifting-line loading distribution and the dual-compact thickness noise model in PSU-WOPWOP. With the forward flight capability developed in UCD-QuietFly, broadband noise is obtained, including trailing-edge noise, trailing-edge bluntness noise, and airfoil stall noise. The air taxi designs, with varied tip speeds and the same mission specifications, are studied for their tonal noise and broadband noise. First, it is found that broadband noise is the dominant noise source for the rotor designs with low tip speeds and fewer blades, while tonal noise is dominant for the high-tip-speed designs. Second, for human hearing, A-weighting maintains the importance of broadband noise while reduces tonal noise significantly. Third, broadband noise is the dominant noise source for the rotor out-of-plane observers, while tonal noise is dominant for the in-plane observers. Fourth, both tonal noise and broadband noise increase proportionally with increasing the forward speed. Finally, low tip speed and more blades are found to be the preferable design features in terms of psychoacoustic metrics. 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.;6

These capabilities are demonstrated for a six-passenger quadrotor reference vehicle design using collective-pitch control.

One of the major components of this vision is urban air mobility (UAM) for the masses. UAM means a safe and efficient system for vehicles to move passengers and cargo within a city. In order to reach UAMs full market potential the vehicle will have to be autonomous. One of the primary challenges of autonomous flight is dealing with off-nominal events, both common and unforeseen, thus, intelligent contingency management (ICM) is one of the enabling technologies.

N/A;2021;M.+V.+Bendarkar D.+Sarojini E.+Harrison D.+N.+Mavris;Evaluation Of Off-Nominal Performance And Reliability Of A Distributed Electric Propulsion Aircraft During Early Design;General Aviation (GA) is likely to be at the forefront of a paradigm change in aviation, where the introduction of novel concepts such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM), architectures like VTOL, and technologies like Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) are expected to make aircraft more efficient and reduce their environmental footprint. However, these architectures carry with them an uncertainty related to the off-nominal operational risk they pose. The limitations and off-nominal operational considerations generally postulated during traditional safety analysis may not be complete or correct for new technologies. While a lot of the literature surveyed focuses on improving traditional methods of safety analysis, it still does not completely address the limitations caused due to insufficient knowledge and experience with transformative technologies. The research objective of the present work is to integrate the Bayesian safety assessment framework developed previously by the authors with conceptual and 6-DoF performance models for DEP aircraft to evaluate off-nominal performance and reliability using information that is typically available in conceptual or preliminary design phases. A case study on the electric power architecture of the the NASA Maxwell X-57 Mod. IV is provided. A maximum potential flight path angle metric, as well as trimmability considerations using a 6-DoF model constructed using available literature help determine hazard severity of power degradation scenarios. Bayesian failure rate posteriors are constructed for the different components in the traction power system, which are used in a Bayesian decision framework. The results indicate that while most of the components in the traction power architecture of the X-57 Mod. IV are compliant with failure rate requirements generated, the batteries, cruise motors, and cruise motor-inverters do not meet those requirements. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Designing an urban air mobility system requires several strategic decisions, in particular on the fleet composition and the charging infrastructure. Simultaneously, operational aspects like the allocation of vehicles to trips, the energy consumption and time restrictions must be taken into account. To cope with the high planning complexity, an optimization model is developed to determine an optimal system design considering key parameters like battery capacity, charging infrastructure, time restrictions and additional technical specifications such as payload and range capacities of vehicles. The feasibility of an urban air mobility system based on state-of-the-art technology in a case study for the district Upper Bavaria in Germany is demonstrated. It is shown that energy costs account for a large part of the total costs, with a significant proportion caused by deadheading flights. Small batteries with a medium charging power are sufficient for most flights and are therefore selected for the majority of the fleet. The results validate the applied approach, however, also reveal the need for an integrated planning model. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;6

In efforts to alleviate these problems in metropolitan cities, logistics companies plan to introduce a new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) service called air taxis. These are electric-powered vehicles that would be tested and operated in the forthcoming years by international transportation companies like Airbus, Uber, and Kitty Hawk. Since these flying taxis are an emerging mode of transportation, it is necessary to provide recommendations for initial design, implementation, and operation. This study proposes managerial insights for these upcoming UAM services by analyzing online customer reviews and conducting an internal assessment of helicopter operations. Helicopters are similar to air taxis in regards to their vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this research, wherein online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis are proposed in Stage 4. The insights obtained in this paper could assist any air taxi company in providing better customer service when they venture into the market. 2020 The AuthorsIndustrial engineering, Systems engineering, Environmental assessment, Information science, Psychology, Air taxi, Helicopter services, Text analytics, Online customer reviews, Urban air mobility (UAM), Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) 2020 The Authors;6

The present article describes a numerical activity that aimed to the systematic study of the rotor-rotor aerodynamic interaction with application to the flight conditions typical of eVTOL aircraft. The activity considers the use of a novel mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver based on vortex particle method. In particular, numerical simulations were performed when considering two propellers both in side-by-side and tandem configuration with different separation distances. The results of numerical simulations showed a slight reduction of the propellers performance in side-by-side configuration, while a remarkable loss of thrust in the order of 40% and a reduction of about 20% of the propulsive efficiency were found in tandem configuration, particularly when the propeller disks are completely overlapped. Moreover, the flow field analysis enabled providing a detailed insight regarding the flow physics involved in such aerodynamic interactions. 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;6

This work further explores the eVTOL design space, by presenting an analysis of a six-passenger eVTOL quadrotor powertrain, with integrated power, propulsion, and thermal management systems modeled using the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) and the NPSS Power System Library. Four powertrain architectures are modeled at the same design point and compared over a design mission. Results from an architecture trade study show that a hybrid architecture performs best in terms of range, however, the hybrid needs batteries with high specific energy and specific power in order to obtain a benefit over turboelectric architectures. Parameteric sensitivity studies are conducted to determine correlations between component parameters and system metrics. This data provides useful indicators for further technological improvement. Lastly an initial TMS model is presented, and sensitivity studies on TMS design parameters are presented as well, to show high level TMS design trends. 2020 AIAA.;6

This included studying the use of an airspeed scheduled switching system that would switch the aircraft's control architecture from a low speed helicopter control system to a high speed airplane control system. Additionally, a novel thrust control allocation scheme is presented. This new scheme combines the variable collective pitch and variable rotor speed allocation schemes into a unified, complimentary filtering based, control allocation scheme. This new scheme is compared against the original constituent schemes on the basis of time simulations, stability margins and handling qualities. The successful operation of the control architecture switching system, was demonstrated via time domain simulations. It was also found that the combined control allocation scheme did not have better performance than the variable collective pitch scheme. However, the combined scheme did offer some improved performance over the variable rotor speed scheme. Especially when electric motor torque limits are enforced. The combined control allocation scheme was able to perform maneuvers that the variable rotor speed scheme could not. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;6

However, there is a drawback in the electric aviation development since the battery power and energy densities are not sufficient for all mission concepts of urban air mobility. Therefore, the hybrid electric configurations are outstanding concepts to reach future concepts of air mobility. In this paper, two hybrid electric concepts of urban air mobility, which are lift-cruise and multicopter, are designed conceptually for intercity mission (city-to-near city) with different range and hybrid power allocation settings. Top level requirements including mission profile, VTOL aircraft configuration and hybrid electric propulsion are defined according to technology assessment of Uber Elevate and Transformative Vertical Flight studies. Initial sizing of both configurations is performed with multidisciplinary optimization approach which includes component sizing, mission performance analysis and weight estimation. As a result of study, maximum takeoff weight, internal combustion engine weight and battery weight increase dramatically for both configurations as range and hybridization factor increase. It is seemed that more battery power dependent configurations are not feasible for intercity mission considering todays battery technology. For hybrid electric VTOL aircrafts, more ICE power dependent configurations should be preferred in intracity missions. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Very different types of UAS are used for applications such as aerial photography, inspection, emergency and Urban Air Mobility (UAM), operating in low altitude and urban environment, as well as in high altitude airspace integrated with the conventional air transportation system. As a new airspace user, UAS brings novel safety challenges to the current aviation system. For current aviation the main safety issues concern first and second parties, i.e. lives and property of crew and passengers. In contrast, the main safety concern of UAS operations is third party risk (TPR), i.e. the risk posed to people and properties that have no responsibility for the UAS operation and neither benefit in some way from the UAS operation. In order to ensure the safe operation of UAS, there is a need for an evaluation of safety regulation developments for UAS operations against relevant TPR indicators. The aim of this paper is to identify relevant TPR indicators for UAS operations and to evaluate safety regulations against these TPR indicators. The main finding is that current UAS safety regulations do not consider the accumulation of TPR contributions from many UAS flights per annum over rural or urban populations. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Estimates concur that there are around 250 startup businesses with 22 major players working on such technologies with over $25 billion dollars in venture capital funding in 2017[1]. Given the meteoric rise of Air Mobility as one of the leading 21st century disruptive technologies, research effort across the spectrum of functions that can make AM concepts a reality are burgeoning-ranging from vehicle design to operations planning. More specifically, research efforts within the operations planning space deal with service route identification, ground infrastructure (such as charging stations and ports) placement and others. To this effect, the present study seeks to evaluate the feasibility and tractability of a formalized optimization method towards the siting of vertiports-ground infrastructure that aids the embarkation and disembarkation of AM commuters-as applied to a Sub-Urban Air Mobility (sUAM) operating model. Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) formulations offer qualified benefits over other heuristic methods and the authors are confident of their relative performance given the proven track record of such methods in solving generalized facility location problems (GFLP). In this study, two optimization problems were considered: capacitated vertiport siting, where any vertiport considered would need to adhere to capacity constraints, and uncapacitated vertiport siting, where any vertiport considered does not have any capacity limit and can service unlimited demand.

Low specific energy of onboard lithium-ion polymer batteries and wind conditions impose constraints on flight endurance. Therefore, from the safety and efficiency perspective, planning and flying minimum energy trajectories are important. The primary motivation for this paper is to determine if there is an operational benefit to flying wind-optimal trajectories for short flights (less than 60 miles) in the urban environment. This study employs wind-optimal trajectories for a NASA-proposed conceptual multirotor aircraft flight in the urban environment. The optimal control model presented includes a wind model for quantifying the effect of wind on the trajectory. The optimal control problem is numerically solved using the direct method. Energy consumption and flight duration flying wind-optimal trajectories between origins and destinations in a metropolitan area are compared with energy consumption and flight duration flying on the great-circle paths between the same origin and destination pairs to determine the operational benefit of wind-optimal routing for short flights. The flight duration results for different scenarios are validated using a simulation tool designed and developed by NASA for exploring advanced air traffic management concepts. In summary, this research study suggests that for short flights in an urban environment, the wind-optimal trajectories have a very slight (insignificant) operational advantage over the great-circle trajectories in terms of energy consumption and flight duration. As expected, headwinds and tailwinds along the route of flight have a significant impact on energy consumption and flight duration. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The introduction of innovative aircraft (such as electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles) undergoing novel operations (such as for an urban air passenger carrying mission) is a potential disruptor to the current means of regulating and ensuring the safety of air travel. The aviation industry and associated regulatory bodies are adapting their approaches to assuring system safety to enable these new paradigms. However, any system safety analysis requires that a hazard assessment be performed. In this work, we consider the Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) and Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) techniques for hazard assessment and evaluate whether they can be used in a complementary fashion for regulatory approval purposes. We perform an FHA and an STPA on an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle undergoing an urban air mobility (UAM) passenger carrying reference scenario and present excerpts of this analysis. We then draw parallels between the techniques and highlight elements where they naturally reinforce to each others results, specifically in the consideration of hazard severity with respect to flight phases, the design of hazard mitigations, and the applicability of the results to all types of regulatory approvals (e.g., type certification, operational approval, and crew training). 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.1109/ICNSURV.2019.8735297;2019;C.+Reiche C.+Mcgillen J.+Siegel F.+Brody;Are We Ready To Weather Urban Air Mobility (Uam)?;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a system for passenger and air cargo transportation within an urban area. It includes small package delivery and other urban unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and supports a mix of onboard piloted, ground-piloted and increasingly autonomous operations. UAM is developing rapidly due to advances in technology. Several aerospace and vehicle manufacturers are developing automated aerial vehicle and piloted aerial vehicle prototypes, and pilot projects are underway in Dubai and planned for Dallas and Los Angeles in the early 2020s. The UAM market is broad and includes potential applications such as air taxi, personal commuting, air ambulance, and law enforcement. Due to the recent emergence of this technology, there has been little research into the potentially significant weather impacts on safety, cost, and efficiency of UAM operations and vehicles.Conducted as part of a comprehensive UAM market assessment, this research identifies potential key weather barriers to UAM due to a variety of weather conditions and public perception of flying in adverse weather. To characterize challenging weather conditions, a comprehensive seasonal and diurnal climatology was generated based on historical observations across anticipated UAM operational altitudes (surface - 5000 ft AGL) at ten focus urban areas in the United States. Weather related societal barriers to UAM were evaluated through a large general population survey where respondents were asked about their views regarding flying in a UAM vehicle amid various adverse weather conditions. Regional variability in weather conditions and potential barriers were also evaluated and will be described. 2019 IEEE.;6

Attracted by the potentially large commuter and personal air travel market, companies such as Uber and Airbus are working towards launching their UAM services in near future. As the type of fleet deployed and the nature of operations in UAM are inherently different than ground-based transportation, new concepts and procedures are currently being developed to ensure safety and efficiency of such operations which will take place alongside traditional aviation. Additionally, new models of operations management are needed to support strategic and tactical decision making of the service providers, such as scheduling, dispatching and fleet planning, for maximizing their preferred objectives. Although such models will be critical to the success of the enterprise, no research, to the best of our knowledge, has yet been conducted on developing these models. Taking into account the unique set of operational constraints associated with UAM services, this paper proposes mathematical models for commercial transport service providers to decide which type of scheduling to offer, how to dispatch the fleet and schedule operations, based on simulated market demand, such that profit is maximized. The optimal fleet size can also be determined using the models. Three different settings of services  on-demand service, scheduled service, and a mix of both services (hybrid operations)  are modeled for carrying out a comparative analysis of the different forms of operations based on metrics such as fraction of total demand served and profit. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This has led to a renewed interest in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Sub-Urban Air Mobility (SUAM) concepts of operations to reduce transportation time and mitigate these concerns. Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft have been investigated extensively but suffer from shortcomings related to rotor noise and vehicle energy efficiency. Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft present a unique capability to overcome some of these shortcomings while providing an easier path to certification. The research builds upon previous research carried out by the authors by accounting for both the impact of environmental factors and the proximity of neighboring obstacles. Suitable airpark locations are first identified with the purpose of fitting runways. Prevailing weather patterns are then analyzed to identify appropriate sets of runway orientations. Surrounding obstacles identified using LIDAR data provided by the United States Geological Survey are analyzed next to generate ground roll as well as departure and approach gradient requirements. This information is then processed in a parametric environment that help assess the airpark geodensity for various combinations of ground rolls and departure or approach gradients. This helps generate vehicle performance requirements that would ensure successful SUAM operations. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;6
N/A;2019;M.+W.+Bauer;First Assessment Of Community Noise For A Simulated Scenario Of New Urban Air Traffic;There is a growing interest for so-called urban air mobility in the future, which may increasingly make use of small airborne taxis, usually 2- or 4-seated electrically driven aircraft. The aerospace industry, but also new technology companies are showing a more and more awareness for this potential market, and several concepts for such light air vehicles are already existing: Some of these air taxis are already flying on a demonstrator level, some are still in a stage of design study. All of them are making use of electrical or hybrid-electrical distributed propulsion, consisting of rotors or propellers - in some cases counter rotating - or fan jets. Additional noise generation may be also appearing due to specific installation effects. In any case, the propulsion sources will generate predominant noise, which will be important for the later assessment of community noise in the vicinity of air taxi hubs, but also for the expected en-route noise due to rather low flight levels. The future noise situation in the communities, potentially coming from this new urban individual transportation, has not yet been discussed in detail since there are no reliable noise data available for the different air taxi vehicle concepts. Sufficient information on hub locations, number of operations and flight path routing is also not available or discussed yet. But both are crucial for the environmental noise assessment. This paper is giving a description of a first assessment study, established on the basis of a simulated air taxi scenario. This scenario describes several hubs in the urban area of a larger German city. Those hubs are to connect urban regions of specific interest. The paper gives a detailed description how the study will be covering the most important aspects for a later modelling and mapping of community/en-route noise and its assessment Proceedings of the 26th International Congress on Sound and Vibration, ICSV 2019.

N/A;2019;J.+Putnam J.+Littell;Evaluation Of Impact Energy Attenuators And Composite Material Designs Of A Uam Vtol Concept Vehicle;The development of Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles for the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) markets presents a need for light weight vehicle structures with effective occupant protection capabilities. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working to fill that need, recently developing a cadre of concept vehicles to help characterize UAM design feasibility. This paper describes a study, using these concept vehicles, to evaluate the use of advanced composite structure and energy attenuating designs in the UAM vehicle design space. A finite element model (FEM) of a single passenger quadrotor concept vehicle was developed in LS-Dyna and simulated under nominal and off-nominal vertical impact conditions. A variety of energy attenuating design mechanisms were implemented within this model to quantify their effectiveness in improving occupant safety. The use of carbon composites in both the energy attenuation mechanisms and vehicle structure was evaluated. The results of this study found significant reduction in occupant injury risk with the implementation of energy absorbing composite crush tubes and landing gear within the vehicle design. Additionally the use of a carbon fiber as a structural material was found to provide significant weight reduction while maintaining similar occupant loads to that predicted with an aluminum structure. This work provides a preliminary evaluation of design mechanisms and materials that may be used to optimize occupant protection capabilities within the UAM market. 2019 Vertical Flight Society.

N/A;2019;J.+Littell J.+Putnam R.+Hardy;The Evaluation Of Composite Energy Absorbers For Use In Uam Evtol Vehicle Impact Attenuation;The demand for new personal air-taxi services is leading to the development of lightweight Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles with electric propulsion for the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) industry. Manufacturers (OEMs) are considering many different designs to develop a vehicle that is able to take-off, cruise, and land autonomously with seating arrangements ranging between 2 and 15 passengers. It is unclear at present how the eventual market will mature, however, one of the common design characteristics noted by many of the OEMs is the use of advanced materials such as composites. A test and analysis program was initiated at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) in 2018 to evaluate the impact attenuation capabilities of various composite material systems with the goal of eventual implementation into an eVTOL vehicle. A series of 3-inch diameter by 6-inch length tubular specimens were fabricated from different material systems which included both traditional carbon and hybrid woven layers of fibers. Additionally, a subset of specimens were filled with closed-cell polyisocyanurate foam to help both with stabilization and crush response. The ultimate goal of the test program was to design a specimen capable of limiting the sustained crush acceleration to 20 g through a stable crush progression. After a series of material tests, these specimens were evaluated under both static and dynamic conditions for impact energy attenuation characteristics and crush stability. Additionally, a series of simulation models were developed in parallel to the test efforts. It is anticipated that the models developed using the component level test efforts can be used to help guide the development of a design for use in full-scale eVTOL vehicle applications.

10.1109/DASC.2018.8569689;2018;S.+D.+Young C.+Quach K.+Goebel J.+Nowinski;In-Time Safety Assurance Systems For Emerging Autonomous Flight Operations;As aviation adopts new operational paradigms, new vehicle types, and new technologies to broaden airspace capability and efficiency, maintaining a safe system will require recognition and timely mitigation of new safety issues as they emerge and before they become hazards. A shift toward a more predictive risk mitigation capability becomes critical to meet this challenge. In-time safety assurance comprises monitoring, assessment, and mitigation functions that proactively reduce risk in complex operational environments wherein the interplay of hazards may not be known, and cannot be accounted for at design time. They also can help to understand and predict emergent effects caused by the increased use of automation or autonomous functions that may exhibit unexpected non-deterministic behaviors. The envisioned monitoring functions can observe these behaviors and apply model-based and data-driven methods to drive downstream assessment and mitigation functions, thereby providing a level of run-time assurance. This paper presents a preliminary conceptual design of such an intime safety assurance system for highly-autonomous aircraft operating at low altitudes near and over populated areas. Research, development, and evaluation tests are initially aimed at public-use surveillance missions such as those needed for infrastructure inspection, facility management, emergency response, law enforcement, and/or security. A longer term goal is to support transportation missions such as medical specimen delivery and urban air mobility. Safety-critical risks initially addressed within the system concept were identified in previous work by NASA and others in industry. These include: flight outside of approved airspace, unsafe proximity to people or property, critical system failures including loss of link, loss or degraded positioning system performance, loss of power, and engine failure, loss-of-control due to envelope excursion or flight control system failure, and cyber-security related risks. 2018 IEEE.;6
10.1109/DASC.2018.8569516;2018;S.+Tuchen;Role Of Aviation In Seamless End-To-End Mobility;As end consumers are becoming the source of information, providing their location, plans, and preferences, they are inviting services that tailor to their needs, on demand. Mobility is one such service that is witnessing transformation towards an end user orientation, aiming for a seamless journey, from end to end, that crosses the boundaries between modes of transportation and transaction. In this paper, we focus on the role of aviation in the inter-modal end-to-end journey. In particular, we focus on a key enabler - a system wide information management system (SWIM) that is key to sharing data between the different modes of transportation, their systems, stakeholders and users. We assess the role of aviation in inter-modal mobility in two respects: (1) Aviation as a segment in an inter-modal journey. Air transportation is inter-modal since, as aircraft carry passengers from gate to gate, other modes of transportation are necessary to complete the journey between the gates and the end points of the trip. We will discuss the impact of connectivity and end user orientation on this traditional air transportation model. (2) Aviation serving end-to-end markets. As most inter-modal efforts have focused on urban mobility, where multiple modes of transportation compete and complement each other, aviation remained largely foreign to this integration. This is likely to change with the advent of urban air mobility (UAM), which promises to compete with other modes of transportation in the urban environment. This transformation will require end-to-end, user-oriented air travel models, unlike the traditional gate-to-gate models. We will expand on extending SWIM adopted for aviation to other modes of mobility as a core enabler for real-time data sharing across modalities, networks, and seamless mobility. SWIM has been a successful Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) technology for increasing information sharing among the stakeholders of the national airspace system (NAS). It enabled connecting the aircraft, the airline operators, and the service providers to increase collaborative and distributed decision making (CDM). Expanding such a technology to connect with and among the other modes of mobility and with passengers, will be key for enabling seamless mobility. SWIM consists of standards, infrastructure, and governance that enable the management of air traffic management (ATM)-related information and how it is exchanged between users. This is an important concept as we start to exchange data between the airlines and add new entrants into the NAS such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and UAM and share information with other transportation networks. For example, exchanging data with the airlines through SWIM collaborative decision making (CDM) enabled automated sequencing and scheduling of flights. Moreover, this platform has enabled creating better prediction algorithms and helps air traffic controllers manage workload. The paper will identify and discuss a Seamless Mobility Information architecture expanding on the SWIM capabilities and model which is a key for end to end mobility. In addition, it will propose an application in disruption management that can be developed and researched. 2018 IEEE.;6

Preliminary, mostly vehicle-level analysis suggests that passenger-carrying Urban Air Mobility has the potential to provide meaningful door-to-door trip time savings compared to identical trips taken solely by automobile, even for relatively short trips of a few tens of miles. Subsequent analysis has shown that if such trips can be conducted at costs competitive with ground transportation, the demand for such flight operations, not surprisingly, becomes unprecedented by historical airspace operations counts, raising fundamental questions regarding feasibility, practicality, capacity and basic system attributes such as separation criteria. In this paper, we conduct a preliminary assessment of vertipad requirements and en route separation minima relative to the feasibility of large-scale urban aviation operations. This analysis is acknowledged as being far from comprehensive and is intended to help define the initial boundaries of an airspace system compatible with enabling high-volume operations. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Growth of the city population is leading to higher traffic volumes and a demand for improved transportation. In order to come up with a solution for the huge traffic in big cities, the idea of On-Demand Mobility (ODM) or the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has been introduced. In this idea, a portion of the transportation in cities is switching from the ground to the air. To make this happen, an air traffic management system is needed to control the traffic in the air. However, there are some challenges to face and one of them is the ICAO addressing for On-Demand Mobility. In this paper, a brief summary of the On-Demand Mobility and the ADS-B system for flying cars is discussed. Following that, some solutions are suggested and some simulations are conducted to figure out how the ICAO addressing works for flying cars. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.3390/electronics11071071;2022;L.+Preis M.+Hornung;Vertiport Operations Modeling, Agent-Based Simulation And Parameter Value Specification;Urban air mobility (UAM) is the idea of creating a future mobility market through the introduction of a new mode of aerial transport with substantial travel time advantages. A key factor diminishing travel time savings is vertiport processes. So far, vertiport throughput capacity has only been studied in a static manner using analytical methods, which has been found to be insufficient. This paper wants to increase the level of understanding of operational dynamics on vertiport airfields by being the first to apply agent-based simulation. For this purpose, an existing vertiport model consisting of pads, gates and stands was refined through two means. First, a sensitivity study with over 100 simulations was executed shedding light on the driving processes on a vertiport airfield. Second, an expert interview series with 17 participants was conducted, letting the experts evaluate the model and specify relevant parameter values. Three main results should find mention here: (1) Pad operations were identified to be most impactful on passenger delays. (2) Pad and gate processes have a threshold capacity beyond which delays increase exponentially. (3) A refined vertiport model is presented, including the 27 most relevant parameters and their value specification. In conclusion, this paper finds that optimized vertiport airfield design is crucial to UAM operations, and dynamic passenger and vehicle interactions cannot be neglected. 2022 by the authors.

These configurations feature electrical power systems and distributed propulsion architectures, both uncommon in current aircraft. As such, the design of eVTOL aircraft lies outside the bounds of current established frameworks and poses many challenges in the field of preliminary aircraft design. This paper presents a preliminary design methodology for open rotor eVTOL configurations with batteries as the power source. First, the propeller external dimensions are calculated, and then an optimised blade geometry for cruise condition is computed. Thereupon, the batteries and electric motors are sized. The design framework is then applied to an eVTOL aircraft with a design range of 400 km and a capacity of five occupants (four passengers and one pilot), focusing on the central-European market and aimed to be released in 2030. The final configuration is a battery-powered tandem-wing aircraft with 12 variable-pitch, variable-speed open rotors placed on the leading edges of the wings. These rotors rotate outboard-down and feature six blades. The power source comprises 24 solid-state lithium batteries with a nominal voltage of 500 V and an assumed energy density of 500 Wh/kg. The proposed design methodology offers the possibility of computing the necessary propeller geometry for numerical simulations in the early stages of the design, and of easily obtaining accurate estimates for the mass of the power system which can improve the overall mass estimates for the analysed configuration. 2021 by the authors.

10.1016/j.trc.2021.103385;2021;Q.+Shao M.+Shao Y.+Lu;Terminal Area Control Rules And Evtol Adaptive Scheduling Model For Multi-Vertiport System In Urban Air Mobility;On the one hand, vertiports in economically developed areas will present the operation mode of multi-vertiport, and the contradiction between the development of urban air mobility and limited operating resources is very serious. On the other hand, unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have different operating processes and limited battery energy supply. Long flight times in the terminal area pose a risk of exhaustion and great safety challenges. Given the terminal area of the multi-vertiport system (MVS-TA), this paper investigates the adaptive control system (ACS), which includes the design of the operating environment and the integrated scheduling model. The design of the operating environment is the basis of adaptive management, which consists of the concept of multi-ring structure and the junction control rules based on backpressure policy. Considering the power constraint and dynamic priority, an integrated model including path planning model and distributed sequencing model is constructed to solve the cooperative scheduling problem of approach-departure flights. Results from numerical analyses reveal that: First, in the case of large flight flow, ACS can achieve the efficiency and safety of MVS-TA operation better than the traditional control system. Secondly, the flight density into the terminal area has a greater impact on ACS performance relative to flight volume. With a density of less than 120 flights/hour, the operating efficiency of MVS-TA under ACS varies within 10.3% with the number of flights or density. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;5

Their environmental noise impact should not be ignored and should be a certification consideration. Numerical simulations can provide means to efficiently assess the noise impact on the complex urban environments, thanks to the advances in both software and hardware. In this study, virtual flights of the noise sources to mimic the drones and urban air mobilities are conducted to investigate the environmental impact by using the Gaussian beam tracing method implemented in an in-house solver Environmental Acoustic Ray Tracing Code, in which the dominant acoustic processes in outdoor applications are modelled. The solver also allows for modelling of sources with generic directivity patterns, which is beneficial for investigating the drone and urban air mobility noise produced by multiple rotors. Two examples of studying noise impact on building and realistic urban environment are conducted. The effects of the surface acoustic impedance, source type and flight path are investigated. By using the efficient simulation solver, the noise impact can be quickly assessed through virtual flights, providing a promising approach to assist the low-noise flight planning and noise certification. 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS;5
10.1016/j.trc.2021.103181;2021;K.+Song H.+Yeo;Development Of Optimal Scheduling Strategy And Approach Control Model Of Multicopter Vtol Aircraft For Urban Air Mobility (Uam) Operation;Urban air mobility (UAM) is emerging as a new alternative to solve the traffic problem in the metropolitan area. Industries and government agencies are preparing for the future UAM system and operation. A new ATC (Air Traffic Control) strategy or aircraft separation method that reflects flight characteristics of multicopter VTOL (Vertical Take-off and Landing) aircraft is required. Particularly, approach control around the vertiport is one of the essential issues for the safe and efficient operation of UAM, and strict safety standards are required for service in populated urban areas. In this study, the concept of holding points where multicopter aircraft can hover is introduced, and three scheduling strategies for arriving aircraft are developed and evaluated by comparing the on-time performance (OTP) with hovering time and ground time. BQA (Branch Queuing Approach), SBA (Sequence-based Approach) and, SBAM (sequence-based approach with moving circles) models are proposed and compared. BQA model prioritizes airspace safety by limiting the aircraft's travel path, SBA model allows the aircraft to move freely within the airspace and prioritizes aircraft's arrival sequence, and finally, SBAM adds the moving circle concept to the SBA model. For each model, OTP and loss of separation (LOS) risk of the proposed models are found and they are compared by simulations. The simulation result shows that SBA and BQA have similar punctuality performance and BQA model with no LOS risk is the most efficient approach control model for multicopter VTOL aircraft of UAM. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;5

The Efficiency And Distributional Impacts Of Uam In Different Urban Spatial Structures;Recent technological developments open up possibilities for introducing a vast number of novel mobility concepts in urban environments. One of these new concepts is urban air mobility (UAM). It makes use of passenger drones for on-demand transport in urban settings, promising high travel speeds for those willing and able to pay. This research aims to answer the question how benefits from UAM will be distributed, taking into account the spatial dimension and the differential impacts on low- and high-skilled households. We develop a framework that can more generally be used to assess the welfare impacts resulting from the introduction of novel transport modes. The development of an urban spatial computable general equilibrium model building on the polycentric modelling tradition developed by Anas and co-authors allows for an analysis of mutually dependent effects on the land, labour and product markets, triggered by changes on the transport market. Allowing for an endogenous spatial structure through the introduction of agglomeration effects and an amenity-based approach, the framework investigates the relevance of the initial spatial structure for the impact of the introduction of UAM. Incorporating different skill levels of households allows to assess location choice and travel behaviour for households with different characteristics. A numerical simulation of the model shows that the different initial spatial structures impose comparable welfare changes. Variations in UAM features like marginal cost, prices, land demand for infrastructure, vertical travel speed and access and egress times have a (much) more decisive impact on modal choice and welfare effects than the initial urban structure. Simulations show that considering households of different skill levels brings additional insights, as welfare effects of UAM introduction strongly differ between groups and sometimes even go in opposing directions. 2021 The Author(s);5
10.2514/6.2021-2540;2021;S.+Conley D.+Shirazi;Comparing Simulation Results From Charm And Rotcfd To The Multirotor Test Bed Experimental Data;Advanced multirotor vertical flight aircraft concepts are emerging faster than rigorous individualized tests can investigate their utility and performance. There are several analysis tools that predict multirotor performance and flow characteristics, but the accuracy of these predictions is still being debated due to lack of experimental data from multirotor tests that are needed to validate the analyses . The objective of this paper is to simulate multirotor configurations using two different mid-fidelity rotorcraft analysis tools, Comprehensive Hierarchical Aeromechanics Rotorcraft Model (CHARM) and Rotorcraft Computational Fluid Dynamics (RotCFD), and compare the simulation results to experimental data from a wind tunnel test of the Multirotor Test Bed (MTB). The MTB, developed by NASA Ames Research Center, is a new capability for testing a wide array of advanced vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) rotor configurations, with a primary focus on testing in the U.S. Army 7-by 10-Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. The MTB was designed to allow adjustment of the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal placement of up to six rotors, as well as allow tilt adjustment of each rotor and pitch adjustment of the whole assembly. The six-axis load cells under each rotor give the MTB the capability of measuring the rotor performance in a wide array of configurations. The overall goal of the MTB project is to help gain a better understanding of the performance, control, interactional aerodynamics, and acoustics of multirotor and tilting-rotor systems. For the work presented here, the MTB data were used to validate RotCFD and CHARM results for several multirotor test configurations. With confidence in both analyses established by the validation exercise, additional simulations were performed to explore quadrotor configurations that will be tested during the MTBs second wind tunnel entry planned for 2022. This second tunnel entry will examine quadrotor configurations that represent published NASA reference designs for urban air mobility concept vehicles. Results from this paper confirm the ability of RotCFD and CHARM to simulate multirotor aerodynamic interactions on individual rotor performance under edgewise forward-flight conditions. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

This paper discusses the safety and security considerations in the topic areas of: Safe autonomy, reliable multisensor navigation, robust and efficient communication, U-space and safe air traffic, and finally cyber-physical safety and security. As a basis for future discussion, the challenges and gaps are identified, furthermore the research in the context of the project is briefly outlined. From a safety perspective, the missing pilot of an autonomous vehicle is equivalent to a missing fallback layer, which has to be mitigated. Additionally, trust needs to be established for new techniques, specifically machine learning, which has recently gained massive interest. To solve this, verification, standardization, and regulation aspects of autonomy have to be addressed. The research is therefore targeted towards assessing and increasing the safety of autonomous operations. Moreover, a multi-sensor navigation system is necessary to achieve required safety levels in challenging environments, while meeting the cost and weight constraints. In order to ensure the integrity of the navigation system, an innovative integrity monitoring architecture for the multi-sensor solution will be investigated in the UAM context. Furthermore, many flying vehicles will need to share information in a reliable and trustworthy manner. Therefore, a robust and efficient communication system is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the future urban air mobility in order to mitigate midair collisions. To achieve safe air traffic, U-space services would have to be established. The project will specifically address gaps in the proposed services and identify additional required information and services. As a last aspect, the cyber physical safety and security has to be considered. With highly connected systems, attacks can happen over the Internet from virtually anywhere. Therefore, it is required to establish a holistic approach for cyber-physical safety and security. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;5
10.2514/6.2021-2471;2021;M.+A.+Clarke R.+M.+Erhard J.+J.+Alonso;Aerodynamic Optimization Of Wing-Mounted Propeller Configurations For Distributed Electric Propulsion Architectures;In this paper, we demonstrate the use of new capabilities in the SUAVE open-source design environment to optimize multi-propeller and multi-rotor aircraft. Departing from traditional single-point approaches, the design objective of minimizing total energy consumed over the entire mission profile guarantees arrival to a mission-level optima. This holistic approach to vehicle design serves to ensure that optimizations are not biased to one flight condition, making it particularly applicable in instances where the numerous flight profile segments are of comparable duration, as is the case of regional and urban air mobility. This study utilizes SUAVEs medium-fidelity aerodynamic analysis module that comprises semi-empirical and numerical models for analyzing propellers, rotors, lifting surfaces and their interactions. Methods are validated using wind tunnel data. We then examine three distinct aircraft configurations that are projected to facilitate future short-range commuter travel. Two of these aircraft possess distributed electric propulsion architectures, in which propulsors are situated around the airframe. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

The focus of this research paper is to understand how trajectory prediction errors affect separation and scheduling services and to understand how these services can work together to mitigate the effects of these errors. Using both analytical and simulation methods, we look at conflict-detection-only scenarios to understand how wind errors and network properties affect required minimum temporal separation between crossing flights. Next, we study how trajectory errors affect conflict resolution and explore different combinations of scheduling and separation assurance to mitigate the effects of uncertainty between crossing flights. The detection study shows that the minimum temporal separation at a crossing point is dependent on several factors including inbound crossing angle, wind heading, and wind-magnitude uncertainty. The separation and resolution study compares the qualitative properties of three different schedul-ing/separation concepts and shows that using a combination of strategic, flow-based scheduling, tactical scheduling at crossings, speed control near crossing points, and separation management leads to a system that is insensitive to trajectory prediction errors while maintaining high network-throughput and flexibility for aircraft away from shared resources. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

But the emissions produced by a UAM mode must be studied in relation to these benefits. In this paper, an emissions model for the UAM context using electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is developed that incorporates CO2 gases emitted from the electricity production required to charge the vehicle batteries. The model quantifies trip emissions using UAM for part or all of the trip and compares these with automobile-based trips. The estimations consider using gasoline and electric automobiles, with the impact of autonomy and average ground speeds in traffic. Trip case studies in the Chicago and Dallas metropolitan areas showcase the regional differences when using UAM and different automobile technology scenarios. In particular, differences stemming from how electricity generation from power grids (i.e., grid emission index) contributes to CO2 emissions of eVTOL trips and electric automobile trips in the Chicago and Dallas metropolitan areas are computed. This paper introduces trip properties called the surface-to-air distance ratio and the detour ratio to understand how they influence the CO2 emissions of a trip. Results from the simulation on identified trip cases in Chicago and Dallas illustrate the significant impact of the grid emission index of a regions power plant on the emissions of electric vehicles.

This question has increasingly been concerning scientists, companies, policy makers, and authorities as more and more UAM vehicle concepts are seeing the light of day. In order to come closer to answering this question and to demonstrate the dependencies and impacts of the numerous parameters used to describe a highly complex system of a fleet of UAM vehicles operating in an urban environment, this paper employs a System of Systems (SoS) approach. A collaborative SoS framework with an agent-based simulation is introduced, which connects the UAM vehicle design, fleet performance, vertiport network, and re-energizing infrastructure with a Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). The framework is used to simulate four exemplary UAM fleet-operation scenarios based on two cities and two operational modes, namely urban and suburban operations. Different vehicle design configurations, e.g. multirotor and lift + cruise vehicles, are evaluated in each scenario based on respectively realistic Concepts of Operations (CONOPS). Additionally, two different points in time, namely 2025 and 2050, are considered and assessed for powering the vehicles by taking into account the characteristics of batteries as well as the underlying electricity mix for their operation. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide battery and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered. The SoS framework helps to asses various UAM metrics such as the average wait time for a passenger, the ideal number of aircraft needed for transporting all passengers within given time, the energy required on a vehicle and fleet level, sustainability metrics, e.g. the global warming potential associated with the energy carriers and many more. The capability to explore a wide design space and to visualize the dependencies between the system parameters and their impacts on different SoS metrics provides stakeholders with a helpful tool for their decision making. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.3397/IN-2021-1482;2021;S.+A.+Rizzi M.+Rafaelof;Community Noise Assessment Of Urban Air Mobility Vehicle Operations Using The Faa Aviation Environmental Design Tool;In contrast to most commercial air traffic today, vehicles serving the urban air mobility (UAM) market are anticipated to operate in communities close to the public at large. The approved model for assessing environmental impact of air traffic actions in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration's Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT), does not support analysis of such operations due to a combined lack of a UAM aircraft performance model and aircraft noise data. This paper discusses the initial development of a method to assess the acoustic impact of UAM fleet operations on the community using AEDT and demonstrates its use for representative UAM operations. In particular, methods were developed using fixed-point flight profiles and user-supplied noise data in a manner that avoids unwanted behavior in AEDT. A set of 32 routes in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area were assessed for single and multiple (fleet) operations for two concept vehicles. INTER-NOISE 2021 .All right reserved.;5
N/A;2021;J.+Sagaga S.+Lee;Acoustic Predictions For The Side-By-Side Air Taxi Rotor In Hover;In this paper, acoustic predictions are performed for the rotors of NASA's side-by-side Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft in hover. Investigations of the acoustics are performed on four overlap configurations, 0%, 5%, 15%, and 25%, in hover via high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. CFD simulations are carried out using the HPCMP CREATETM-AV Helios and acoustics calculations are conducted using PSU-WOPWOP. Blade airloads and performance of the rotors are computed for this study. Predictions on the rotor airloads and wake geometry are compared for all overlap configurations at a collective pitch angle of 8. It is shown that the 25% overlap configuration yields a higher overall sound pressure level (OASPL) than for the other overlap configurations, mainly due to stronger blade-vortex-interactions at the entrance and exit locations of the overlap region. It is found that the OASPL difference in hover is above 62 dB at an altitude of 500 ft (152.4 m), which is the UAM aircraft noise guideline suggested by Uber. Additionally, noise for all overlap cases are compared against various background noise levels. Results show that noise from the side-by-side rotor could not be fully concealed by the various background noise at an altitude of 500 ft (152.4 m). Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

10.1017/aer.2020.52;2021;A.+Filippone G.+N.+Barakos;Rotorcraft Systems For Urban Air Mobility: A Reality Check;Urban air vehicles have been hailed as the next revolution in aviation. Prototypes of various sizes have been flown to demonstrate basic flight (hover and climb), but in most cases there is no demonstration of full flight capability, for example conversion from vertical to level flight (conversion corridor). There are proposals for vehicles in a wide range of scales: from drones specifically designed to deliver goods, to full size vehicles for manned transportation. Most of the concepts proposed include full electric propulsion, multiple (often convertible) rotors (ducted or un-ducted, counter-rotating), and widespread use of composite materials. Start-up companies are seeking funding with high-profile demonstrations in front of the media, but many unresolved technical problems are not been solved. Large aerospace companies have joined the fray. These initiatives are fuelling expectations that achieving the next milestone is within easy reach. This paper aims to fill some gaps in understanding and curb optimism. It takes a holistic view in order to establish a scientific basis for design, manufacturing, operations. ;5

However, the viability of deploying Urban Air Mobility (UAM) solutions in our daily life depends on many critical safety factors. One of the most pivotal key players in the UAM safety aspect is their capability for accurately landing on narrow and unplanned urban lading spots. Subsequently, processing the elevation sensory data by depending on a single array-based sensor unit has many drawbacks in case of sudden electronically failure or spontaneous obstacle shadowing effects. In this paper, we proposed a multicore systolic real-time processing unit that is capable to increase the automation requirement levels for future UAMs through adopting parallel and complex sensory fusion computer architectures for increasing the accuracy of UAM during the landing process. The novel Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) processing unit is interactively dealing with Multiple Sensor Nodes (MSN) that are both frequency spectrum and spatially separated on the bottom side of an UAM. The proposed idea is surpassing the conventional single sensor-array based-solutions for UAM landing process in terms of improving the accuracy and safety concerns. The proposed systolic FLS architecture in this paper has been designed and tested using MATLAB and VHDL to be interfaced with five Lidar Sensors and five ultrasonic sensors using the Intel Altera OpenVINO FPGA board. The proposed systolic FLS processing unit achieved a processing computational speed of about 25.3 Giga Operations per Seconds (GOPS) and only 178.12 mW as core dynamic thermal power dissipation. 2020 IEEE.;5
10.1109/TAES.2019.2953417;2020;S.+H.+Kim;Receding Horizon Scheduling Of On-Demand Urban Air Mobility With Heterogeneous Fleet;Mobility on demand (MoD) is a new paradigm of personal mobility that responds to passengers' demands in real time, and urban air mobility (UAM) is an area of MoD enabled by advances in electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. This demand-responsive nature of MoD poses a challenge for optimally scheduling vehicles, and it has attracted much attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of research in the MoD scheduling literature: a homogeneous fleet is assumed, but it is not necessarily true all the time. Hence, this article proposes a novel formulation of the scheduling problem for UAM with a heterogeneous fleet and presents particle swarm optimization and a genetic algorithm that utilize a greedy algorithm to keep solutions feasible. The proposed algorithms are implemented with a model-predictive control scheme to effectively manage the demand-responsive nature. As a result, the proposed algorithms can find a near-optimal solution in a short time. Using the algorithms, a numerical experiment with six different fleet mixes is conducted, and impacts of fleet heterogeneity are analyzed. As a result, it is shown that the fleet heterogeneity affects both the quality of service and operational efficiency, and there is a tradeoff: the more vehicles and seats, the better the service, but the less efficient it is. 1965-2011 IEEE.;5
10.2514/6.2020-2796;2020;O.+Pinti A.+A.+Oberai R.+J.+Niemiec F.+Gandhi;A Multi-Fidelity Approach To Predicting Rotor Aerodynamic Interactions;Recent years have seen a huge interest in large electric multicopters for Urban Air Mobility, commercial package delivery, and military/law enforcement applications. This has lead to a growing interest in modeling the interactional aerodynamic effects of rotors operating in close proximity and their impact on performance. While CFD can be used to understand the detailed physics of multi-rotor interaction, in most cases it is too computationally demanding for performing optimization and uncertainty quantification studies over a range of parameters. On the other hand, lower-fidelity models approximate the underlying physics and are computationally inexpensive, however they are often inaccurate in predicting the desired fields of interest. With this in mind, in this study we present a multi-fidelity approach that inherits the computational efficiency of a low-fidelity model while retaining the accuracy of a high-fidelity method. This approach is based on using the low-fidelity model to span the entire space of parameters, using these results to identify the key parameter values to perform high-fidelity simulations, and then using these in a lifting procedure to determine multi-fidelity solutions at other parameter values. In this manuscript we apply this strategy to determine the disk plots of lift and drag for the two rotors of a multicopter as a function of the longitudinal and vertical distance between them. We note that this strategy can substantially improve upon the low-fidelity results. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;5

This work examines the ability of the UAM ecosystem and the operations within it to meet a variety of demand profiles that may emerge in the coming years. We perform a set of simulation driven feasibility and scalability analyses based on UAM operational models with the goal of estimating capacity and throughput for a given set of parameters that represent an operational UAM ecosystem. UAM ecosystem design guidelines, vehicle constraints, and effective operational policies can be drawn from our analysis. Results show that, while critical for enabling UAM, the performance of the UAM ecosystem is robust to variations in ground infrastructure and fleet design decisions, while being sensitive to decisions for fleet and traffic management policies. We show that so long as the ecosystem design parameters for ground infrastructure and fleet design fall within a sensible range, the performance of the UAM ecosystem is affected by the policies used to manage the UAM traffic. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A big challenge associated with the introduction of these new operations is ensuring that the complex system-of-systems responsible for these operations known as Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) meet the high safety standards of aviation. In this work, we present a general purpose framework for validating decision making systems, protocols, and algorithms that may exist in the UTM ecosystem. We propose a novel, simulation driven approach for validation in UTM that can automatically discover the failure modes of a decision making system, and optimize the parameters that configure the system to improve its performance. We apply this approach to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and package delivery use cases, and examine in detail the failure modes and the potential improvements of two UTM services critical for strategic deconfliction: trajectory planning and optimal scheduling. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to discover failure modes in the system that would be challenging for humans to find and fix, and we show how the algorithm can learn from these failure modes to improve the performance of the UTM services in question. We also demonstrate the significant sample efficiency improvements that our algorithm has over naive stress testing approaches that rely on uniform sampling. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

With the emergence of urban air mobility, it is important to consider consumer perceptions of autonomous air taxis and passengers willingness to fly in various conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine what external factors may influence consumers willingness to fly on autonomous air taxis in various weather conditions, terrain, flight time, and population densities. Methods: Across two studies, 782 participants were presented with a definition of autonomous air taxis. Then a hypothetical scenario involving an air taxi that included four variables: rain versus no rain (Weather), 5-minute flight versus 30-minute flight (Flight Time), over land or water (Terrain), and over urban or rural areas (Population Density). Results: The data from the study suggest that both United States and Indian passengers were more willing to fly in good weather conditions versus rainy weather, over land versus over water, and on short flights versus longer flights. Conclusions: As urban air mobility becomes more well-known, it is important to understand consumer opinions and educate them on emerging technology. This, in turn, can aid industries in developing marketing strategies to help increase awareness of new technologies in the future. 2020, University Aviation Association. All rights reserved.;5

UAM is an aviation industry term for passenger or cargo-carrying air transportation services, which are often automated, operating in an urban/city environment. UAM-style vehicles are expected to use vertical takeoff and landing with fixed wing cruise flight. Metrosim is a metroplex-wide route and airport planning tool that can also be used in standalone mode as a simulation tool. The scenarios described and reported in this paper were used to evaluate a fleet noise prediction capability for this tool. The work was a collaborative effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Intelligent Automation, Inc (IAI), and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). One scenario was designed to represent an expanded air-taxi operation from existing helipads around Manhattan to the major New York airports. The other case represented a farther term vision case with commuters using personal air vehicles to hub location just outside New York, with an air-taxi service running frequent connector trips to a few key locations inside Manhattan. For both scenarios, the trajectories created for the entire fleet were passed to the Aircraft Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) to generate Day-Night Level (DNL) noise contours for inspection. Without data for actual UAM vehicles available, surrogate AEDT empirical Noise-Power-Distance (NPD) tables used a similar sized current day helicopter as the Baseline, and a version of that same data linearly scaled as the first guess at possible UAM noise data. Details are provided for each of the two scenario configurations, and the output noise contours are presented for the Baseline and reduced noise DNL cases. 2019 IEEE.;5

10.2514/6.2019-1220;2019;E.+S.+Hendricks J.+W.+Chapman E.+D.+Aretskin-Hariton;Load Flow Analysis With Analytic Derivatives For Electric Aircraft Design Optimization;Many of the aircraft concepts of the future are exploring the use of hybrid-, turbo-or all-electric propulsion systems to improve performance and decrease environmental impacts. These aircraft concepts range from small rotorcraft for urban air mobility to conventional commercial transports to large blended wing body designs. Developing the conceptual design for these vehicles presents a challenge, however, as traditional aircraft design tools often were not developed to handle these unique propulsion system architectures. Previous studies on these vehicles have therefore relied on relatively simple models of the electrical transmission and distribution system. This paper presents the development of a hybrid AC-DC load flow (or power flow) analysis capability to enhance the conceptual design of these concept vehicles. Specifically, the desire was to create a load flow analysis capability within the OpenMDAO framework that is also being used to develop a set of compatible tools for rapid optimization of conceptual designs. This load flow analysis capability is unique in its flexible object-oriented structure and implementation of analytic derivatives to facilitate the use of solvers and gradient based optimization in the design process. The developed hybrid load flow analysis capability is first verified against a published 13-bus example then used to model the electrical distribution system for a turbo-electric tiltwing aircraft. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this context, the paper concentrates on eVTOL quadcopters with pure rpm control, pure propeller pitch control and both rpm and propeller pitch control. Dynamic effects of electric motors can potentially have significant effects on the flight characteristics of these vehicles. The paper will demonstrate for a pitch manoeuvre that while varying purely the rpm of the rotors results in a system that behaves as an acceleration-control system, varying purely the propeller pitch corresponds more to a velocity-control system. The rotor pitch control is more sensitive to the coupling rotor-motor and its transients dynamics. Varying both the rpm and the rotor pitch for controlling the pitch manoeuvre is the best option as this brings the system more towards velocity-control behaviour and dampens the transients due to the motor dynamics. 2021;4
10.1016/j.ast.2022.107518;2022;A.+Zanotti D.+Algarotti;Aerodynamic Interaction Between Tandem Overlapping Propellers In Evtol Airplane Mode Flight Condition;The architecture of new electric aircraft concepts (eVTOLs) for urban air mobility is typically characterised by multi-propellers in tandem configurations with different degrees of rotor disks overlapping. Consequently, the aerodynamic interaction between front propellers slipstream and rear propellers represents one of the key-phenomena which influenced the performance and design of these novel aircraft configurations. A wind tunnel campaign was performed to investigate the aerodynamic interaction between two propellers in tandem with particular focus to airplane mode flight condition of eVTOLs. A systematic series of tests, including thrust and torque measurements and stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) surveys, were performed on two co-rotating propellers models. The axial distance was fixed during tests while the lateral separation distance was changed to evaluate the effects of aerodynamic interaction on propellers performance and flow field due to different propeller disks overlapping. Load measurements pointed out a remarkable loss of rear propeller thrust occurring when the degree of overlapping between rotors disks is increased. On the other hand, spectral analysis of measured loads signals showed a higher amount of thrust fluctuations amplitude occurring when the degree of overlapping between propeller disks is partial. Stereo PIV results provided insights on the effects of aerodynamic interaction on rear propeller inflow and wake flow physics. Moreover, numerical simulations performed using a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver based on vortex particle method (VPM) provided enhanced insights to comprehend the interacting flow mechanisms between front propeller slipstream and rear propeller blades responsible for the detrimental effects observed on rear propeller performance. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;4
10.2514/1.C036214;2022;D.+Lee D.+Lim K.+Yee;Generic Design Methodology For Vertical Takeoff And Landing Aircraft With Hybrid-Electric Propulsion;This paper proposes a conceptual methodology for designing vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with a hybrid-electric propulsion system as an alternative to facilitate intercity missions for urban air mobility. Four new modules are developed to consider the diversity of configurations, flight mechanisms, and hybrid-electric propulsion system architectures. The flight-analysis module is proposed to account for various lift-and thrust-generating devices. The hybrid-electric propulsion system sizing module is modified for the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft by additionally considering transition flight. Based on a new proposed battery charge/discharge criterion, the mission-analysis module is constructed to predict the battery capacity and fuel consumption required for a given mission. The weight-estimation module is also developed considering the weight of the mechanical and electric powertrains. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by designing an urban air mobility vehicle and comparing the results with those of other sizing tools. A systematic comparative study and design optimization are carried out to highlight the improvement in the performance of the hybrid-electric-powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft compared to its battery-driven counterpart. The extended mission range of the designed aircraft presents the possibility of intercity urban air mobility vehicles. 2022, AIAA International. All rights reserved.;4
10.2514/1.J060803;2022;Y.+Hong D.+Lee K.+Yee S.+H.+Park;Enhanced High-Order Scheme For High-Resolution Rotorcraft Flowfield Analysis;The recent growing interest in urban air mobility (UAM) worldwide has led to the demand for physical analyses of the aerodynamic performance and aeroacoustic characteristics of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) rotorcraft. In a UAM eVTOL rotorcraft, the smaller vortices generated from multiple propulsors interact with lifting surfaces such as wings, fuselage, and propellers in a complex manner. Therefore, to accurately predict the performance and noise of UAM eVTOL rotorcraft, vortices should be preserved with little dissipation, and their interactions must be modeled precisely. These requirements need a numerical algorithm with a refined resolution than that allowed by conventional schemes. This paper proposes a newly modified enhanced multidimensional limiting process (eMLP) for vorticity conservation (eMLP-VC), which improves the original eMLP by accounting for the fact that most rotorcraft flowfields are vortex dominated and subsonic. For advanced capability in preserving vortices, the distinguishing criterion was modified through vortex profile analysis, and low-Mach-number adjustment was performed by reconstructing the interpolated primitive variables. The proposed scheme was applied to wave propagation, shock discontinuity, double Mach reflection, propellerwing interaction, and Second Higher-Harmonic Control Aeroacoustic Rotor Test problems. The computed results confirmed that eMLP-VC exhibits superior resolution, numerical stability, and computational time efficiency as compared to the multidimensional limiting process, eMLP, and weighted essentially nonoscillatory methods. 2021 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Nevertheless, the current low battery energy density limits the application of these propulsive architectures to large transport aircraft. In the context of the general aviation category, full-electric aircraft for the so-called Urban Air Mobility scenario are gaining increasing interest. These air taxis, also called e-VTOL, are conceived to exploit vertical take-off and landing capabilities, to carry people from one point to another, typically within the same city. In this paper, a new conceptual design methodology for urban air vehicles is presented and applied to an innovative convertiplane, called TiltOne, based on a box-wing architecture coupled with tilt-wing mechanisms. Several TiltOne configurations have been designed according to the current regulations imposed by European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and sensitivity analyses have been carried out on the varying main design parameters, such as wing loading and propellers disk loading, as well as main top-level aircraft requirements. The results provide an overview for todays operational capabilities of such aircraft and, in addition, depict possible scenarios for a near-future horizon, based on the assumption of increased performance levels for the electric powertrain components. In such scenario, two different concepts of operations are analysed and discussed: the first is based on a given design range, long enough to cover the urban distances, the second is conceived to exploit the capability of flying multiple shorter missions with a single battery charge. The designed TiltOne configurations derived from these different approaches are presented, highlighting their potential capabilities and possible drawbacks. 2021 by the authors.

These prototypes incorporate electric and hybrid powertrains for multi-rotor and tilt-rotor crafts. Many eVTOLS are using batteries for propulsion and charging them rapidly between the flights or swapping them for slow charging overnight. Rapid charging degrades the battery cycle life while swapping requires multiple batteries and charging stations. This study has conducted a technoeconomic evaluation of the eVTOL air taxis with alternate powertrains using hydrogen fuel cell systems being developed for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. We consider performance metrics such as fuel cell engine power, weight, and durability, hydrogen consumption and weight of storage system, and maximum take-off weight. The metrics for economic evaluation are capital cost, operating and maintenance cost, fuel cost, and the total cost of ownership (TCO). We compare the performance and TCO of battery, fuel cell and fuel cell  battery hybrid powertrains for multi-rotor and tilt-rotor crafts. We show that fuel cells are the only viable concept for powering multi-rotor eVTOLs on an urban scenario that requires 60-mile range, and hybrid fuel cells are superior to batteries as powertrains for tiltrotor eVTOLs. 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC;4

We developed algorithms to find the optimal radius of airspace for each concept and, through simulations, derived comparisons among them. We also introduced the concept of a vertiport terminal control area where an personal air vehicle (PAV) approach control is performed, which consists of holding points and holding circles. Two strategies of PAV movement into the inner holding circles were proposed: the sequence-based approach (SBA) and the branch-queuing approach (BQA). The efficiency of these strategies was compared through a simulation, which demonstrated that the SBA is suitable for a space-constrained vertiport design and the BQA for a safer airspace design. 2021, The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.;4

With UAM, cargo and passengers will be transported on-demand in urban airspace. UAM has shown a promising prospect in mitigating ground congestion and providing people with an alternative mobility option. However, unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban airspace present a significant threat to safety of UAM, drawing significant attention from research communities recently. Among all solutions, cooperative pursuit using a team of UAVs is an effective countermeasure for unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace. In this paper, we model cooperative pursuit as a pursuit-evasion game problem (PEG) and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based approach to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed approach incorporates novel cellular-enabled parameter sharing and curriculum learning schemes to enhance the capability of pursuer UAVs in capturing faster unauthorized UAVs in urban airspace. Extensive experiments have been conducted using simulated urban airspace in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the parameter sharing scheme, the proposed methods provide much higher capturing rates in a shorter time. Such superiority is more evident when communication constraints are more stringent and/or unauthorized UAVs are faster. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;4

10.1016/j.eng.2020.11.007;2021;Z.+Wu Y.+Zhang;Integrated Network Design And Demand Forecast For On-Demand Urban Air Mobility;Urban air mobility (UAM) is an emerging concept proposed in recent years that uses electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs). UAM is expected to offer an alternative way of transporting passengers and goods in urban areas with significantly improved mobility by making use of low-altitude airspace. In addition to other essential elements, ground infrastructure of vertiports is needed to transition UAM from concept to operation. This study examines the network design of UAM on-demand service, with a particular focus on the use of integer programming and a solution algorithm to determine the optimal locations of vertiports, user allocation to vertiports, and vertiport access- and egress-mode choices while considering the interactions between vertiport locations and potential UAM travel demand. A case study based on simulated disaggregate travel demand data of the Tampa Bay area in Florida, USA was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Candidate vertiport locations were obtained by analyzing a three-dimensional (3D) geographic information system (GIS) map developed from lidar data of Florida and physical and regulation constraints of eVTOL operations at vertiports. Optimal locations of vertiports were determined to achieve the minimal total generalized cost, however, the modeling structure allows each user to select a better mode between ground transportation and UAM in terms of generalized cost. The outcomes of the case study reveal that although the percentage of trips that switched from ground mode to multimodal UAM was small, users choosing the UAM service benefited from significant time saving. In addition, the impact of different parameter settings on the demand for UAM service was explored from the supply side, and different pricing strategies were tested that might influence potential demand and revenue generation for UAM operators. The combined effects of the number of vertiports and pricing strategies were also analyzed. The findings from this study offer in-depth planning and managerial insights for municipal decision-makers and UAM operators. The conclusion of this paper discusses caveats to the study, ongoing efforts by the authors, and future directions in UAM research. 2021 THE AUTHORS;4

UAM is a concept mode of transportation designed to bypass ground congestion for time-sensitive, price-inelastic travelers using autonomous, electric aircraft with Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. Airport ground access trips constitute a trip purpose that can utilize this mode. This study analyzes originating ground access trips for two major airports in the Dallas-Fort Worth region: Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL). First, a mode choice model is calibrated on the existing airport ground access behavior. UAM demand is then estimated using the developed model, airspace restrictions, and the results from UAM demand stated-preference surveys in literature. Airspace restrictions consist of unusable pieces of airspaces based on current air traffic patterns, where the placement of UAM vertiports and overflying of UAM vehicles are prohibited. The demand model considers the trajectories of the UAM vehicles, which navigate on pre-defined routes inside Class-B airspace to prevent Air Traffic Control (ATC) involvement requirements. This study includes sensitivity analyses of UAM demand to the cost per passenger mile (CPM), number of vertiports placed in the region, and other secondary factors like vertiport location, intermodal cost, fixed cost, and average speed. Corridors with significant UAM demand are identified from the spatial distribution of demand and potential bottlenecks in the UAM network. The findings predict up to 4% market share of UAM for trips to the airport at the optimistically lower fare of $2 per passenger mile (in addition to the fixed cost of $23) and a 50-vertiport UAM network. Average Value of Times (VOTs) for business and non-business travelers are estimated to be around $57/hr and $36/hr, respectively. Business travelers comprise three-quarters of the total UAM demand because of relatively higher VOTs. Airport access trips in Dallas-Fort Worth region have considerable potential for UAM if the trip's price is below $4 per passenger mile (in addition to the fixed cost of $23). 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aims to address this gap using hybrid and full-electric Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs) as a source of accessible, ondemand transportation. To achieve success with PAVs, reduction of mass is imperative due to the current battery capacity constraints. This can be achieved using advanced materials such as Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs) paired with advanced design tools such as topology and composite optimization. Presently, existing literature in UAM design is focused on conceptual design optimization with high-level structural considerations for only conventional materials, which leaves significant weight savings unrealized. This work addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a structural optimization methodology for CFRP based UAM design applied to a PAV concept created in collaboration with Queens University, Konkuk University, and KCTECH. A comparison between a CFRP and a conventional aluminum design shows a mass reduction of 54.1% using CFRP construction while meeting the same design requirements. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, its viability as a transport mode will be strongly determined by benefits in travel time. Hence, before optimizing the planning and infrastructure provision for UAMs deployment, the dynamics of UAM trips must first be simulated and understood in order to determine the total addressable market. This work contributes to the existing scholarship in several ways. First, we use an ultra-fast parallelized, GPU-based microsimulator, MANTA, to study the regional characteristics of UAM trips compared to driving trips, simulating millions of morning trips in the San Francisco Bay Area. Second, we provide a novel, data-driven approach to determine the demand of multi-modal UAM in different network designs, leveraging the speed of MANTA for iterative convergence. Third, we provide a granular yet regional-scale analysis of trips, showing congestions sensitivity to the number of vertiports as well as transfer times. The number of benefited trips from UAM increases most significantly when the vertiport network expands from 10 to 30 vertiports, with lesser but steady growth beyond 30 vertiports. Assuming a transfer time of 2 minutes at each of the origin and destination vertiports, results indicate that the average distance of trips that benefit from multi-modal UAM decreases, ranging from approximately 54 km to 30 km, as the number of vertiports increases incrementally from 10 to 100. Travel times on the ground improve at all network designs, but the extent of benefit increases as the number of vertiports increases. Finally, we note that there is an equity component to UAM, in which travelers who do not opt to take UAM at all still benefit from the efficiency increases in the transportation network. This suggests that at particular network designs and deployments, UAM can be valuable to an entire metropolitan area. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

However, definition of these large-scale simulations is time-consuming and the tools available are not specialized for requirements specific to SoS. Furthermore, with the plethora of scientific packages available as Python packages, creating a bespoke simulation toolkit with this language will allow engineers to rapidly analyze case studies. An emphasis is placed on a SoS approach utilizing Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) in this paper as it is beneficial to capture emergent properties while developing new multi-vehicle platforms in a complex operational environment. This paper presents the development process and feature highlights of a toolkit to support SoS Inverse Aircraft Design applications.

10.2514/1.I010954;2021;Z.+Wang D.+Delahaye J.+L.+Farges S.+Alam;Air Traffic Assignment For Intensive Urban Air Mobility Operations;In high-density urban air mobility (UAM) operations, mitigating congestion and reducing structural constraints are key challenges. Pioneering urban airspace design projects expect the air vehicles to fit into structured UAM corridor networks. However, most existing air transport networks are not capable of handling the increasing traffic demand, which is likely to cause congestion, traffic complexity, and safety issues. To adapt the increasing demand to the current airspace capacity, a novel macroscopic traffic assignment model is proposed to mitigate the congestion and organize the structure of air traffic flow. Firstly, the UAM corridor is designed and fitted into graph representation. Then, a traffic assignment problem based on linear dynamic system is formalized to minimize the congestion factors and the intrinsic air traffic complexity. A two-step resolution method based on Dafermoss algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve this optimization problem. A case study is carried out on a two-layer air transport network with intensive UAM operations. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully mitigate urban airspace congestion and organize the UAM traffic into a low-complexity flow pattern. This approach can be used as a tool to assist air navigation service provider in strategic planning for a given transportation network. AIAA International. All rights reserved.;4

With the advent of the use of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, considering electric vehicles known as eVTOL (electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing), multiple problems in the urban environment appear. Also, as multiple vehicles are expected to be used to obtain urban mobility in dense metropolitan regions around the world, the concept of UAM (Urban Air Mobility) emerges as a way to assure environment air control. To not compromise the future of UAM, researchers were faced with the challenge of structuring the airspace with specific air traffic rules, with separations between vehicles lower than those currently applied, without reducing the aviation required safety levels. As testing in a real scenario is not practical, simulation is a form to gather data and define parameters for this new system. This work aims to present a computational tool that uses multiple agents to generate different UAM scenarios, being possible to analyse the impact that simulation input parameters variation will cause in the safety indicators proposed in the model.

It will also provide details of the hybrid-electric engine simulation developed in MATLAB with Simulink and Simscape to test the control logic. Simulation models of the internal combustion engine, generator, inverter-motor controller, battery pack, load generator (UAM vehicle) along with a supervisory controller are detailed in the paper.

N/A;2021;S.+J.+Wright;Fundamental Aeroelastic Analysis Of An Urban Air Mobility Rotor;A computational investigation was conducted of the aeroelastic characteristics of a representative rotor typical of aircraft for Urban Air Mobility. A rotorcraft comprehensive analysis was used to examine the aeroelastic characteristics of the model, both in hover and in forward flight. Throughout the study, parameters examined included rotor rotational speed, forward flight speed, blade torsion stiffness, and chordwise locations of the blade elastic axis and center of gravity. Three sets of airfoil properties were analyzed: NACA 0012, VR8, and VR12. For hover, the effect of dynamic inflow was studied via a comparison of uniform inflow and dynamic inflow models. Thrust coefficient and blade tip twist were analyzed to ascertain performance characteristics, and eigen analysis was employed to determine stability. For the forward flight cases, rpm and forward flight speed were swept separately, and the effect of each on performance and stability was assessed. Thrust coefficient and mean drag coefficient were used to evaluate performance of the rotor, and eigen analysis was invoked to study rotor stability. Forward flight stability results generated via a constant coefficient analysis were compared with results generated via Floquet Theory. 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;4

This problem is particularly relevant in the development of autonomous vehicles, especially in the concept of urban air mobility. The actual usage of the vehicle will be used to predict stresses in the structure and therefore to define maintenance scheduling. Machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, can be used to create surrogate finite element models that map a reduced set of data coming from real-time measurements of a structure into a detailed/high-fidelity finite element analysis model of the same system. As a result, the FEA-based machine learning approach directly estimates the dynamic response over the entire system during operations, thus improving the ability to define ad-hoc, safe and efficient maintenance procedures. The predictive performance of random forest algorithm is presented for direct estimation of the acceleration distribution over a beam structure. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

As a first step, it is critical to understand the capabilities and gaps in sensing technologies ability to perceive vehicle state, environmental conditions and obstacles, as these capabilities impose fundamental limits on the autonomous systems ability to fly safely. This effort aims to measure the ability of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sensors to meet the needs of perception systems for UAM operation. The select sensors must also meet the constrained size weight power and cost (SWAP-C) necessary to meet the demands of urban air vehicles. This paper gives an overview of our preliminary gap analysis approach, including an overview of the functions of an autonomous perception system, and surveys of COTS sensor capabilities. Sense and avoid, of both static (terrain, buildings, hovering vehicles) and dynamic (aircraft, small drones, birds) obstacles, is identified as a challenge. Initial results are presented, showing many COTS capabilities have limited margins in meeting this need, and may fall short depending on processing times. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This paper presents a novel airspace management approach for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) below the skyline in particular. A robust airspace discretization methodology is developed based on the expected navigation performance. Additionally, a novel methodology is developed to optimally generate airspace sectors from discrete 3D airspace cells. A preliminary verification of the novel airspace structuring methodology is performed based on navigation performance with a reference navigation architecture based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The proposed performance-based discretization methodology promotes operational safety and efficiency and supports enhanced UTM operators' situational awareness under dense traffic conditions. The analysis performed demonstrates that the proposed airspace model can efficiently accommodate unmanned aircraft with varying avionics equipment and can be expanded to a full Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) performance-based approach, allowing a continuous dynamic optimisation of airspace capacity. 2020 IEEE.;4

A key element of UAM are vertiports, the infrastructure that electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) use to land and take-off. A Vertiport Design Tool (VDT) was developed for use by architecture firms designing vertiports to evaluate operational trade-offs between vertiport surface area and vehicle throughput. A stochastic Monte Carlo simulation was developed to calculate vehicle throughput for different vertiport design alternatives, safety risk, and noise constraints. Results show that for every 420 m2 increase in vertiport surface area, the throughput increases by one vehicle per hour. For this, the time between vehicle arrivals also needs to decrease by 5 minutes for more arrivals to occur. 2020 IEEE.;4
N/A;2020;Z.+Jia S.+Lee;Acoustic Analysis Of Urban Air Mobility Quadrotor Aircraft;This paper investigates the acoustics of a 1-passenger and a 6-passenger quadrotor Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft designs in level flight based on a high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. The CFD simulations are carried out using the HPCMP CREATETM-AV rotorcraft analysis and simulation tool Helios. The acoustic simulations are performed using the acoustic prediction tool PSU-WOPWOP. A total of three CFD models is simulated: 1-passenger isolated rotor configuration, 1-passenger full configuration, 6-passenger isolated rotor configuration. The noise comparison between the 1-passenger isolated rotor and full configurations shows that the vehicle fuselage can increase the A-weighted sound pressure level (SPL) up to 5 dB. An acoustic comparison between the 1-passenger and 6-passenger configurations suggests that the maximum difference in overall SPL between the two configuration is 14 dB. Furthermore, it is shown that the noise of 1-passenger and 6-passenger configurations is significantly lower than that of a four-bladed conventional helicopter in level flight. However, there is still a challenge to meet the community noise acceptance level so that further noise reduction is recommended. The community noise impact of UAM aircraft is also assessed and compared to background noise in different scenarios. The results show that the 1-passenger vehicle noise can be fully masked by the highway noise at an altitude greater or equal to 1,000 ft while the 6-passenger vehicle noise can only be partially covered by the ambient noise.

10.2514/6.2020-2905;2020;P.+D.+Vascik R.+J.+Hansman;Allocation Of Airspace Cutouts To Enable Procedurally Separated Small Aircraft Operations In Terminal Areas;The current air traffic control (ATC) system is human-centric and voice-based. As a result, separation minima, controller workload, and radio frequency limitations may restrict the number of emerging unmanned aircraft system (UAS) or urban air mobility (UAM) operations that can occur within congested airspace. Limited ATC capacity will be especially impactful for UAS or UAM operations in proximity to large airports. One concept to reduce ATC limitations is to re-allocate airspace to develop procedurally separated corridors or regions where UAS and UAM aircraft may operate without receiving conventional ATC services. The creation of such airspace cutouts currently enables hundreds of daily small aircraft and helicopter operations in major U.S. cities without contributing to ATC workload. This paper develops an approach to analytically identify terminal airspace that is procedurally segregated from large aircraft operations and may be appropriate for new airspace cutouts. The magnitude of the benefit of allocating airspace in this manner is demonstrated at three major airports and in the 34 largest metropolitan areas of the United States. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2020-3192;2020;M.+Xue;Urban Air Mobility Conflict Resolution: Centralized Or Decentralized?;This work begins to address one of the critical questions in the urban air mobility and small unmanned aircraft communities: Should the en-route conflict resolution function in an urban air mobility traffic system be centralized or decentralized? Three conflict resolution architectures are modeled and analyzed: centralized, decentralized with uniform rules, and decentralized with mixed rules. This study compares these architectures and investigates their robustness to communication and state information errors in terms of safety and efficiency metrics. Experiments are conducted using a high-fidelity Monte Carlo traffic simulator and a generic set of traffic scenarios with increasing traffic density. When no errors were modeled, the centralized architecture marginally outperformed the decentralized architecture. However, performance of the centralized architecture was found to be adversely affected by the modeled input errors to a greater degree than was the decentralized architecture. Performance of the centralized architecture also was degraded significantly by the modeled transmission errors of the centralized resolution maneuvers. In the decentralized architecture, uniform rules outperformed mixed rules because, in the mixed rules case, system safety performance was undermined and dominated by the poor performers. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The primary objective of these tests was to acquire flight data in forward and descending flight for the purpose of assessing the fidelity of an all-attitude flight dynamics simulation previously developed from static and dynamic wind tunnel data. A secondary objective was to demonstrate and mature free-flight test methods specific to the emerging class of small unmanned aircraft and urban air mobility vehicles. Experimental flight data correlated well with simulation predictions which included steady trim conditions consistent with straight and level flight, and quasi-steady conditions associated with descent velocities prone to vortex ring state development. The test method was shown to be well suited to these classes of vehicles and several unique infrastructure requirements, including tether systems and data acquisition requirements were identified. In addition, unique operational test techniques and safety procedures were developed to accommodate the testing. Results of these tests will be used to support air traffic management studies and research into safety assurance concepts that enable the integration of these classes of vehicles into the National Airspace System. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This system primarily uses passive optical and acoustic sensors along with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems), or GPS (Global Positioning System) and ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast). The system design, known as Drone Net, is a network of passive sensors designed to cover a kilometer square area. In this paper we present the results of experiments to add an active RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) on the ground and active LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) on flight nodes (small UAS). System tests completed previously have shown feasibility for all passive optical and acoustic UTM and UAM. The point of the RADAR testing is to directly compare passive sensor networks to active to determine the value of each alone and to test the hypothesis that multi-modal active and passive sensing will be superior, but likely at higher cost than passive alone. Previously, we completed coordinated experiments with an EO/IR camera system and acoustic sensor network with an All-sky hemispherical six-camera system with resolution up to 12 million pixels to optimize detection and tracking. For some applications such as corporate campuses and Class-D airports, passive sensing alone might be sufficient and most cost effective, but for urban, military, and higher traffic Class-C and Class-B larger airports, we believe the combined multi-modal purpose-built sUAS RADAR integrated with optical and acoustic sensor networks will be most effective. Based upon our preliminary results presented herein, purpose built small RADAR with wide fields of view configured into an All-sky active system along with optical All-sky cameras and acoustic sensors are ideal for urban locations requiring the highest confidence in monitoring of combined UTM, UAM and GA (General Aviation) traffic. UTM will mostly be small UAS delivering parcels and must share airspace with UAM carrying passengers for short-hop transportation along with general aviation covering longer distances, but also entering urban airspace at airports. Clearly the airspace in urban locations is going to become much more congested, with new risk, but also new opportunity to improve transportation overall. The results we present here are a start at answering basic questions about multi-modal sensor effectiveness for urban navigation, both passive and active. In scenarios where sUAS and UAM may not have reliable GNSS or might not be UTM compliant, the ground detection, tracking and localization is most critical for assured urban airspace safety and security. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2020-0014;2020;E.+D.+Aretskin-Hariton S.+Schnulo E.+Hendricks J.+W.+Chapman;Electrical Cable Design For Urban Air Mobility Aircraft;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) describes a new type of aviation focused on efficient flight within urban areas for moving people and goods. There are many different configurations of UAM vehicles, but they generally use an electric motor driving a propeller or ducted fan powered by batteries or a hybrid electric power generation system. Transmission cables are used to move energy from the storage or generation system to the electric motors. Though terrestrial power transmission cables are well established technology, aviation applications bring a whole host of new design challenges that are not typical considerations in terrestrial applications. Aircraft power transmission cable designs must compromise between resistance-per-length, weight-per-length, volume constraints, and other essential qualities. In this paper we use a multidisciplinary design optimization to explore the sensitivity of these qualities to a representative tiltwing turboelectric UAM aircraft concept. This is performed by coupling propulsion and thermal models for a given mission criteria. Results presented indicate that decreasing cable weight at the expense of increasing cable volume or cooling demand is effective at minimizing maximum takeoff weight (MTO). These findings indicate that subsystem designers should update their modeling approach in order to contribute to system-level optimality for highly-coupled novel aircraft. 2020 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Electric vertical take-off and landing aircrafts, or short air taxis, could potentially offer a local emission-free and infrastructure-conserving solution. Although these so-called air taxis may be ready to use in the next two to three years, however, potential users remain unaware of them. User acceptance represents a key factor for successfully introducing air taxis. The aim of this particular research was to evaluate the current state of perception regarding air taxis as a new technology among potential users in Germany and to identify significant factors that could influence the user acceptance. To this end, 11 potential users were interviewed via qualitative interviews, evaluated using a qualitative content analysis. The results indicate that air taxis are hardly known in the sample, but also that the attitude towards air taxis tends to be positive. Sociodemographic factors (e.g. age) as well as psychological factors (e.g. need for safety) and product-related factors (e.g. price) possibly influence user acceptance regarding air taxis. The results are particularly relevant for cities and governmental authorities, who need to establish new infrastructure and legislation for air taxis, as well as for manufacturers, who will need to find ways to increase user acceptance in order to successfully introduce their air taxis.

If economic predictions come true, thousands of air taxi flights will take place daily in capital cities - not only in megacities. Noise generated by urban flight mobility has been identified as a critical factor in this development. A concept is proposed to help raise the tolerance level for urban air noise among communities as well as of individual residents by means of transparency. This concept views residents as stakeholders in urban air mobility and widens the call for continuous noise measurements of vertical take-off and landing operations on individual site basis [1] by residents voluntary on-site data collection enabled by smartphone-based participatory noise sensing (PNS). In the presentation of this concept, this discussion paper describes important aspects of social acceptance of urban air mobility.  2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 License.;4

We seek to perform mission planning for vehicles in a UAM fleet, while guaranteeing system safety requirements such as traffic separation. In this paper, we present a localized hierarchical planning procedure for the traffic management problem of a fleet of (potentially autonomous) UAM vehicles. We apply decentralized policy synthesis for route planning on individual vehicles, which are modeled by Markov decision processes. We divide the operating region into sectors and use reactive synthesis to generate local runtime enforcement modules or shields, each of which satisfies its own assume-guarantee contract that encodes requirements of conflict management, safety, and interactions with neighbouring sectors. We prove that the realization of these contracts ensures that the entire network of shields satisfies the safety specifications with each shield limited to acting in its local sector of operation.

This article focuses on the required patterns of learning in order to cope with these changes, and what automotive managers can learn from the aerospace industry in this context. As organizational learning is the central parameter of economic evolution, and technology develops over trajectory shifts, companies are, at the very least, cyclically forced to learn ambidextrously, or are squeezed out of the market. They have to act and react as complex adaptive systems in their changing environment. Especially in these dynamics, ambidextrous learning is identified to be a conditio sine qua non for organizational success. Especially the combination of efficiency-oriented internal exploitation with an explorative and external-oriented open innovation network turns out to be a superior strategy. By combining patent data, patent citation analysis and data on the European Framework Programs, we show that there are temporal differences, i.e., position of the product in the product, technique, technology, and industry life cycle. Furthermore, we draw a conclusion dependent on the systemic product character, which enforces different learning requirements concerning supply chain position and, as an overarching conclusion, we identify product structure to be decisive for how organizational learning should be styled. 2019 by the authors.;4
10.15394/ijaaa.2019.1312;2019;K.+A.+Adkins;Urban Flow And Small Unmanned Aerial System Operations In The Built Environment;The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has put forth a set of regulations (Part 107) that govern small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) operations. These regulations restrict unmanned aircraft (UA) from flying over people and their operation to within visual line of sight (VLOS). However, as new applications for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are discovered, their capabilities improve, and regulations evolve, there is an increasing desire to undertake urban operations, such as urban air mobility, package delivery, infrastructure inspection, and surveillance. This built environment poses new weather hazards that include enhanced wind shear and turbulence. The smaller physical dimensions, lower mass and reduced ground speed of UA make them more susceptible to these hazards than their manned counterparts and can have a significant impact on their performance, endurance and the likelihood of accomplishing the mission. Due to current restrictions, very few flight hours have been accumulated confronting these unique weather challenges. In the absence of this data, this article explores a diverse body of literature that analyzes urban flow and discusses the relevant insight it provides to sUAS operations. 2019, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.;4

Only they could enable unprecedented opportunities for scaling drones and air taxis to a large number of vehicles, making the services available for everyone. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, Machine Learning (ML) in particular promise a huge leap towards achieving high levels of automation and further autonomy. Nevertheless, the safety concerns and challenges regarding compliance to the existing software standards are more pressing then ever before. Existing regulatory framework for hardware and software items fail to provide adequate acceptable means of compliance for AI-based systems. Hence, there are currently a number of ongoing efforts to update and augment the current standards. This paper will give an overview of the existing and upcoming regulatory framework for certifying AI-based systems. It will elaborate the EASA documents, artificial intelligence roadmap, Concepts of Design Assurance for Neural Networks (CoDANN), CoDANN II, as well as the concept paper on first usable guidance for level I machine learning applications.

In order to enable this autonomy, systems must be able to build independently an accurate and detailed understanding of the own vehicle state as well as the surrounding environment, this includes detecting and avoiding moving objects in the sky, which can be cooperative (aircraft, UAM vehicles, etc.) as well as noncooperative (smaller drones, birds, ).

10.2514/6.2022-0215;2022;L.+Preis M.+Hornung;Identification Of Driving Processes For Vertiport Operations Using Agent-Based Simulation;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation concept promising to introduce a fast and flexible mode of transport, which may become affordable for the larger public. The anticipated demand coupled with the highly constrained urban environment creates a complex problem for infrastructure. Vertiports, as an interface between air-side and ground-side operations, have garnered some attention, yet the operational dynamics are barely understood today. This paper seeks to shed light on vertiport airfield operations to inform future fields of research and early projects of designing vertiports. Through a customized Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) framework, an entire day of vertiport operations can be simulated. To gain an understanding of the operational dynamics of vertiports this paper will present a sensitivity study looking at variations of (1) demand magnitudes and profiles, (2) pad operations including approach and departure and (3) vehicle turnaround including passenger boarding and de-boarding at gates. One finding is that operations are driven by peaks and asymmetries in demand, which emphasizes the need for high-fidelity analysis of vertiport airfield operations. Another finding is that the threshold between stable and instable operations is narrow and passenger delay increases exponentially beyond this threshold. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The design of hybrid-electric propulsion systems (HEPSs) for rotorcraft is seen as being able to contribute to those goals. This work aims to conduct a comprehensive design and tradeoff analysis of hybrid powerplants for rotorcraft, targeting enhanced payload-range capability and fuel economy. An integrated methodology for the design, performance assessment, and optimal implementation of HEPSs for conceptual rotorcraft has been developed. A multidisciplinary approach is devised comprising models for rotor aerodynamics, flight dynamics, HEPS performance, and weight estimation. All models are validated using experimental or flight test data. The methodology is deployed for the assessment of a hybrid-electric tilt-rotor, modeled after the NASA XV-15. This work targets to provide new insight into the preliminary design and sizing of optimally designed HEPSs for novel tilt-rotor aircraft. The paper demonstrates that at present, current battery energy densities (250 Wh/kg) severely limit the degree of hybridization if a fixed useful payload and range are to be achieved. However, it is also shown that if advancements in battery energy density to 500 Wh/kg are realized, a significant increase in the level of hybridization and hence reduction of fuel burned and carbon output relative to the conventional configuration can be attained. The methodology presented is flexible enough to be applied to alternative rotorcraft configurations and propulsion systems. Copyright 2021 by Rolls-Royce plc;3

A Ranking Of 40 Cities In The United States;Given the high levels of congestion that many commuters in the United States experience, the urban air mobility community has been exploring the potential of using a new class of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commuters. To date, only a few studies have been conducted that compare how potential air taxi demand across cities varies. This study calculates a measure of air taxi demand for commuters for the 40 most populous combined statistical areas (CSAs) in the U.S. by using: (1) cell phone data to identify regular commuters in cities, (2) census data to associate household income characteristics with commuters, and (3) a mode choice model calibrated from a stated preference survey to predict the number of commuters that would use an air taxi. Air taxi commuter demand is concentrated in a handful of CSAs, the CSAs for New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., generate 33 percent of the overall air taxi demand. Results are sensitive to location of existing vertiports, existing ground infrastructure and congestion levels on competing modes, and current commute patterns. A resultant set of online maps of potential air taxi routes allows readers to visualize how air taxi commuter routes differ across CSAs. Results will be of value both to aircraft manufacturers seeking to design air taxi vehicles to serve different cities as well as city planners for identifying where investments in port infrastructure may be needed to support a commuter air taxi service. 2021 The Authors;3
10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115056;2021;S.+Rajendran;Real-Time Dispatching Of Air Taxis In Metropolitan Cities Using A Hybrid Simulation Goal Programming Algorithm;Expected to begin its operations in the coming years, air taxi aims to provide everyday transportation services to customers in metropolitan cities. These vehicles offer urban air mobility (UAM) services using the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology. This research is the first to present a hybrid simulation goal programming (HSGP) approach to dispatch vehicles in a centralized air taxi network. After each customer drop-off, the model makes real-time decisions on (i) whether the air taxi must become idle or pick up customers, and (ii) the station to which the air taxi should be dispatched (if the air taxi is operational). The feasibility of the HSGP approach is tested using potential air taxi demands in New York City (NYC) provided by a prior study. The results of the experimentation suggest that the minimum number of air taxis required for efficient operation in NYC is 84, functioning with an average utilization rate of 66%. In addition, the impacts of commuter's willingness to fly rate, percentage of demand fulfillment, on-road travel limit, maximum customer wait time, and arrival distribution on the optimal number of air taxis, utilization rate, number of customers served, and cost incurred per customer are examined. Analyses show that the willingness to fly rate appears to have a linear influence on the number of air taxis and the efficiency, while on-road travel distance has an exponential impact on the performance measures. The HSGP algorithm developed in this paper can be used by any company that is interested in venturing into the air taxi market. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;3

The aerodynamic interaction between side-by-side propellers represents one of the key phenomena that characterise the flow field and performance of these novel aircraft configurations. The present article describes the main results of a wind tunnel campaign that aimed to investigate the flow features that characterise this aerodynamic interaction, with a particular application to cruise flight conditions in eVTOLs. With this aim, stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were performed in the wake of two co-rotating propeller models in a side-by-side configuration. The three-dimensional flow surveys provided detailed insights into the flow physics of the interacting propellers, with a particular focus on the interactional effects on the trajectory of the tip vortices and the wake topology provided at two different advance ratios by reproducing a moderate and a fast cruise speed of eVTOLs in urban areas. 2021 by the authors.

What type of onboard control for enroute separation assurance increases productivity without compromising safety in the low-altitude airspace? This article quantifies the impact of two conflict detection and resolution approaches - pure speed control and pure direction control - on airspace productivity. We focus on small UAS traffic for goods movement in low altitude (under 400 feet) airspace. We compute three types of metrics, namely throughput, travel time extension and energy consumption, from simulations of unmanned traffic over a representative square area. As the inflow rates are increased, the corresponding outflow rates (throughput), travel time extensions and energy consumption for each type of control are measured. A representative power consumption model is developed for aircraft with both kinds of control. Without compromising safety, both direction control and speed control are equally good, unless the UAS are designed to be highly efficient while hovering. If the UAS have a hover power consumption that is equal to or less than one and a half times the minimum power consumption, speed control increases airspace productivity more than direction control. 2000-2011 IEEE.;3

UAM networks rely on an infrastructure of vertiports, which are closely tied to the ability of the UAM service to operate effectively. This research addresses identifying desirable locations for vertiports while taking into account vehicle limitations, desired operational strategies, and the possibility of passenger trips involving more than two vertiports. The vertiport selection problem is presented as a modified single-allocation p-hub median location problem that incorporates elements of subgraph isomorphism to create structured networks to allow for public transit operations. Because the problem is NP-hard, five heuristic algorithms are developed to find potential solutions with acceptable computation times. The methods are compared to the optimal solution in three different areas of the United States. The most effective of these methods are found to be within 10% of the optimal solution on average, and results indicate that they scale well to larger networks. General trends from the three case study regions examined are also briefly discussed. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;3

To support progress in this area, a conceptual design method for single-main-rotor and lift-augmented compound electric helicopters has been developed. The design method was used to investigate the feasible design space for electric helicopters based on varying mission profiles and technology assumptions. Within the feasible design space, it was found that a crossover boundary exists as a function of cruise distance and hover time where the most efficient configuration changes from a single-main-rotor helicopter to a lift-augmented compound helicopter. In general, for longer cruise distances and shorter hover times, the lift-augmented compound helicopter is the more efficient configuration. An additional study was conducted to investigate the potential benefits of decoupling the main rotor from the tail rotor. This study showed that decoupling the main rotor and tail rotor has the potential to reduce the total mission energy required in all cases, allowing for increases in mission distances and hover times on the order of 5% for a given battery size. 2021 by the authors.

10.2514/6.2021-3202;2021;F.+Naser N.+Peinecke B.+I.+Schuchardt;Air Taxis Vs. Taxicabs: A Simulation Study On The Efficiency Of Uam;Growing urbanization increasingly leads to negative effects on the overall transportation and personal transport traffic. In particular, traffic congestions with huge delays, especially during rush hours are causing problems. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) solutions aim at utilizing the airspace above the city for personal transport by introducing potentially autonomous, small vertical take-off and landing vehicles to tackle this development. This paper explores the advantages of UAM, or air taxis, compared to ground-based taxicabs in terms of route lengths and travel time. For this, a simulation study was carried out for a European metropolitan area, namely the downtown of Hamburg, Germany. A number of places was identified within the area that would be suitable for carrying UAM hubs, so called vertidromes. The study was realized using DLRs drone traffic scenario generator, including technology developed for the in-house 4D trajectory planning and deconfliction solution. Scenarios were based on publicly available map data from OpenStreetMap. The scenarios assume that a direct connection between two hubs is demanded in a regular, short interval of time. Both a UAM connection and a ground transport are then scheduled simultaneously, allowing a direct comparison of travel time and distance. Conflict-free routing is considered for the UAM system. A time saving of 50% for the pure travel time as well as a route length saving of up to 16% for the air taxi vs. taxicab connections could be deduced from the simulation. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These methods can be classified as medium-fidelity, whereby predictions require a fraction of the computing cost of more expensive approaches such as CFD while maintaining a degree of accuracy sufficient to facilitate design optimization. A robust weight build-up method based on certification standards, component geometry and design loads is used to ascertain realistic estimates of takeoff gross weight. These analytical tools are integrated into SUAVE, a system-level simulation test bench for assessing the performance of manned and unmanned aircraft. The sizing of powertrain components is also discussed to highlight best practices in the approach to bring non-conventional vehicle configurations from pen-and-paper to the preliminary design stage. As the first of a series of publications outlining a framework to perform multidisciplinary design optimization, the aircraft studied in this paper cover the major vehicular configurations intended for regional and urban air mobility. These aircraft were simulated through a baseline mission to comparatively assess performance and acoustic footprint measured from ground level. A synopsis of the impact of battery cell cathode chemistry, mission profile and passenger capacity is subsequently held. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The parametric study is performed using an optimal control framework. The parameters considered for the parametric analysis are cruise airspeed, cruise altitude, climb profile, range, and required time of arrival under uncertainties (wind and departure-time). The key results suggest: i) the minimum-energy cruise airspeed (maximum final state of charge) increases with an increase in cruise altitude, ii) the minimum-energy cruise airspeed is independent of range, iii) design a cruise corridor for urban air mobility air traffic at the lowest possible altitude considering eddies/vortices from skyscrapers, other types of air traffic, and vertical obstacles, and iv) wind and departure-time uncertainties could adversely impact the predictability of the usage of the onboard lithium-ion polymer battery pack for an aircraft flying to meet the assigned required time of arrival in the urban air mobility environment. The state of charge results showed high dependence on the battery model. Therefore, this study demonstrates the need to have a validated battery model for the onboard lithium-ion polymer battery pack to predict the state of charge accurately. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

We decompose the flight planning task between a network of vertiports into an offline and an online phase. This work focuses on the offline phase covering the flight planning, which can be validated to fulfill regulatory boundary conditions and target safety levels before flight. In the online phase the planning task is collapsed to a trajectory selection problem, which is low dimensional and provides only solutions with guaranteed feasibility. The proposed method computes a tree of trajectories with constant time separation of branches and leading to both the destination and diversion vertiports from each fork point. We further extend the planning tree with motion primitives to enable transitions between flight levels and local holding patterns for temporal deconfliction without a change of the lateral flight profile. We demonstrate the method in a realistic urban scenario and provide metrics for memory and time complexity of the algorithm. 2021 IEEE.;3

The handling qualities and motor current requirements of a quadcopter, hexacopter and octocopter with equal gross weights (5,360N) and total disk areas (producing a 287N/m <![CDATA[ $^2$ ]]> disk loading) are compared in hover. For axes that rely on the rotor thrust (all except yaw), the increased inertia of the larger rotors on the quadcopter increase the current requirement, relative to vehicles with fewer, smaller rotors. Both the quadcopter and hexacopter have maximum current margin requirements (relative to hover) during a step command in longitudinal velocity. In yaw, rotor inertia is irrelevant, as the reaction torque of the motor is the same whether the rotor is accelerating or overcoming drag. This, combined with the octocopter's greater inertia as well as the fact that it requires 30% less current to drive its motors in hover, results in the octocopter requiring the greatest current margin, relative to hover conditions. To meet handling qualities requirements, the total weight of the motors of the octocopter and hexacopter is comparable at 13.5% weight fraction, but the quadcopter's motors are heavier, requiring 16% weight fraction. If the longitudinal and lateral axes were flown in ACAH mode, rather than TRC mode, the total motor weight of all configurations would be nearly identical, requiring about 13.5% weight fraction for motors (compared to 7-9% weight fraction from hover torque requirements).

These new and increasingly complex operational paradigms such as Advanced and Urban Air Mobility (AAM/UAM) present regulatory authorities and the aviation community with several design and implementation challenges - particularly for highly autonomous vehicles. An overarching and daunting task is finding methods to integrate these emerging operations without compromising safety or disrupting traditional airspace operations. A shift toward a more predictive risk mitigation capability becomes critical to meet this challenge. This paper focus on the development and testing of a prognostic service aimed at estimating the quality of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) performance for an autonomous aircraft in complex environments. The intent of this function is to proactively reduce a flight operations risk of exposure to states that may induce poor or unacceptable navigation system performance by factoring in estimates of GNSS quality into pre-flight and/or in-flight route planning. Methodologies for producing quality estimates are specified and results are provided for selected simulation and flight test cases. 2021 Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2021.

This paper is the first to explore the applicability of airport noise exposure maps to Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The FAAs airport noise compatibility planning program is first described. Then the applicability of the noise exposure map to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is explored. Finally, new airspace infrastructure, including vertiport locations and UAM routes from NASAs UAM engineering simulations, and local noise-sensitive facility locations and land use information were collected and processed to develop the noise exposure maps of UAM near the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The DNL noise contours resulting from a six-passenger electric quadrotor prototype vehicle are predicted using NASAs AIRNOISEUAM software. The noise exposure maps of UAM are generated automatically using Pythons data analysis and visualization libraries. The results have applications for UAMs noise compatibility planning, noise-reducing route planning, and vertiport location selection. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.3397/IN-2021-1333;2021;M.+Bauer;Community Noise From Urban Air Mobility (Uam) And Its Control By Traffic Management;The awareness about Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is amplified by steadily growing numbers of air-taxi concepts being announced. In general, environmentally friendly by electric propulsion, community noise and en-route noise are still prominent open questions. Several studies for larger UAM aircraft, describing the acoustic characteristics of a variety of potential air-taxi concepts, have been performed by the author. Due to the abovementioned multitude of different vehicle concepts and their multiple operational conditions, each of them shows individual sound characteristics. Therefore, further investigations of noise created by complex air-taxi fleets appear to be crucial. Understanding of community noise around vertiports and along air-taxi routes will strongly depend on those fleets. In this paper, acoustically different air-taxi systems are composing different sets of air-taxi fleets, used for air traffic noise simulations. The simulations start with baseline scenarios of equally represented taxi systems on fixed flight paths with several flight levels in a certain air-lane. The final fleets are consisting of random air-taxi composition with randomly populated flight paths. The results, based on common noise metrics and changes in the number of affected residents, could provide a first indication how to reduce community noise by future UAM traffic management.

Viable procedures are restricted to those that enable simultaneous and non-interfering UAM flights with conventional aircraft operations. Air traffic controller workload is proposed as the critical integration barrier to scale UAM operations in visual conditions whereas separation minima, especially for approach procedures, is proposed as the critical barrier in instrument conditions. A systems approach is taken to evaluate potential integration strategies for UAM in which the location of UAM runways or vertipads and flight procedures are presented in a topological framework. The benefits, challenges, and notional application of five integration schemes are discussed. Four promising procedures for UAM are introduced through case studies at three airports. Findings indicate that multiple procedures exist to support high-volume UAM integration at major airports under current regulations with additional controller staffing, especially if UAM aircraft exhibit helicopter-like performance.

N/A;2021;A.+Walter M.+Mckay R.+Niemiec F.+Gandhi;Effects Of Disk Loading On Handling Qualities Of Large-Scale, Variable-Rpm Quadcopters;The performance of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) scale quadcopters with fixed-pitch, variable-speed rotors is examined at different values of disk loading. Three 544kg (1200lb) aircraft are considered in hover with disk loadings of 287N/m2, 574N/m2, and 861N/m2 (6psf, 12psf, and 18psf), corresponding to rotor radii of 1.2m, 0.86m, and 0.70m (4.0ft, 2.8ft, and 2.3ft). Optimized explicit-model-following controllers are designed to meet standard handling qualities criteria using CONDUIT. In trim, it is seen that increased disk loading results in increased power, but with reduced motor torque due to higher rotor speeds. Time domain simulations are considered in order to examine the peak torque required by the aircraft, which is used to estimate required motor weight. Based on a step command in heave rate, a 54% reduction (total reduction of 40.6kg) in motor weight is seen for the 18psf quadcopter. Assuming a step change in rotor speed, the peak torque required for the heave maneuver is also predicted in closed form using an analytical model based on momentum and blade element theory. The analytical model captures the trend in peak torque during the heave rate step response, with predicted values within 12% of the values from the time domain simulation.

N/A;2021;K.+Collins P.+Currier R.+P.+Anderson R.+G.+Fernandes J.+B.+Shivakumar S.+Lahaji;Analysis Of Bus Voltage Sag During High Battery Power Operations On Hybrid Electric Urban Air Mobility Vehicles;This paper analyzes test results performed on a hybrid-electric power generator where the effects of voltage sag caused the inverter to lose the ability to control the generator. The prototype generation system consisted of a four-cylinder Rotax 915iS turbocharged gasoline aviation engine driving a YASA P400RHC high performance generator controlled by a Cascadia PM-150DZ inverter. The system was designed to be incorporated into an eVTOL type of vehicle to provide power to distributed electric rotor systems. The prototype power generation system was connected to an active DC electronic resistive load that pulled current from the prototype based on an arbitrary power versus time profile. When driven by the Rotax at 5,500 RPM and 100% throttle, the YASA generator is capable of producing about 85-90 kW. As more power is demanded from the system, the battery pack - which has a starting voltage of approximately 420 V - has to provide the remaining power. When this power demand from the battery is high, the battery pack voltage begins to drop. The Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) generator has both voltage and current limits that limit the amount of torque the generator can produce to balance the torque input from the Rotax. The voltage limit is partially a function of the bus voltage, which is dictated primarily from the battery pack voltage. When these limits are reached, the system can no longer keep the speed controlled and the Rotax torque, being unbalanced by the YASA, causes the engine to over-speed. This paper analyzes test results where the system is intentionally loaded to produce this behavior and cause the over-speed. A simplified model of the PMSM current and voltage limits are developed to notionally simulate the phenomenon. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;3

With the ever present demand for higher communication data rates and larger bandwidth required by future space exploration missions, optimization of the communications systems supporting such missions is necessary to ensure that critical scientific data and high definition video and imagery of human and robotic exploration is properly transmitted back to Earth. In the aeronautics side, the envisioned increase in aircraft volumes under the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) ecosystems could benefit from communications capabilities impervious to interference and free from spectrum limitations constraints. This work discusses examples of GRC's ongoing technology development and integration efforts relevant to the aforementioned scenarios. In particular, the ability to increase the versatility, affordability, and reliability of ground-based optical receivers for space-to-ground communications will be presented. Our current activities on the development of highly secure airborne laser communications links augmented with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) will also be discussed, as well as scenarios in which optical communications could be beneficial to UAM/AAM.

Existing ATM methods for unmanned aerial systems do not provide guarantees and will not scale to the projected traffic densities for UAM. We provide a decentralized, hierarchical approach for ATM that allows for scalability to high traffic densities as well as providing theoretical guarantees of correctness with respect to linear temporal logic specifications. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a novel ATM architecture that divides control authority between vertihubs that are each in charge of all vehicles in their local airspace. Each vertihub also contains a number of vertiports that are in charge of vehicle takeoffs and landings. The resulting architecture is decentralized and hierarchical, which enables scalability and robustness in the event of any individual vertihub or vertiport no longer being operational. Second, we provide a contract-based correct-by-construction reactive synthesis approach that provably guarantees safety with respect to user-provided safety specifications in linear temporal logic. We demonstrate the approach on realistic large-v IEEE;3
N/A;2021;A.+N.+Das K.+Marotta H.+Idris;Deep Learning-Based Negotiation Strategy Selection For Cooperative Conflict Resolution In Urban Air Mobility; This paper presents a collaborative conflict resolution technique using deep neural network-based intelligent search of the solution space. This approach offers a rapid convergence to a mutually acceptable solution for real-time conflict resolution, suitable for urban air mobility operations. Furthermore, the presented technique allows operational flexibility to the urban air mobility agents where these agents can collaboratively devise the solution via integrative negotiation, based on their local utility functions, as long as such a solution does not violate the global safety thresholds. The presented machine-to-machine negotiation method is built on our prior work on holistic assessment of the airspace and potential conflict detection implemented at-the-edge, onboard the unmanned aircraft systems. This paper extends the prior work to augment decision-making at-the-edge, thereby, promising a true distributed control architecture for urban air mobility. In this approach, each agent (a) builds a potential in-flight conflict map, (b) identifies the conflicting agents, (c) dynamically prepares a list of alternatives based on its current utility functions, (d) negotiates with the conflicting agents to pick one of these alternatives, and (e) implements the negotiated alternative to mutually resolve the conflict. Note that such an approach does not require a contingency plan to be made pre-flight, as the conflict resolution strategies are decided and negotiated in real time based on the present state of the agent. The contingency plan, if available, can serve as an input to the real-time conflict resolution strategy formulation, and also can be used as a fallback plan in case the negotiation fails and the impacted agents need to switch to a rule-based/supervisory resolution mode from the discussed distributed resolution mode. The presented collaborative negotiation-based conflict resolution technique incorporates a time-dependent reward function to catalyze collaborative resolution by incentivizing the agents with local and global rewards beneficial to their business operations. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2021;Z.+Wang P.+Wei L.+Sun;Optimal Cruise, Descent, And Landing Of Evtol Vehicles For Urban Air Mobility Using Convex Optimization;In this paper, we propose a novel approach to trajectory optimization of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles for urban air mobility (UAM) missions such as passenger transportation and cargo delivery. Our particular interest is to develop efficient algorithms that facilitate fast generation of optimal cruise, descent, and landing trajectories for eVTOL vehicles under operational constraints. As a preliminary study, we focus on the formulation of an optimal control problem with fixed time of flight and choose the control effort as the performance measure for a multirotor eVTOL vehicle. The main contribution of this work is the convexification of the formulated optimal control problem to better enable real-time trajectory optimization with required time of arrival, which is of key importance for future eVTOL operations. The convexification process is presented in this paper. The EHang 184 eVTOL vehicle is used in the simulations, and preliminary results of a UAM transportation case are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

While these flying cars' propulsive technology has almost become economically viable, the infrastructure to allow these vehicles to operate in an urban environment is still lacking. With numerous known vulnerabilities in UAVs and commercial aircraft, manufacturers have not addressed cybersecurity in the scope of urban air mobility. This paper presents a review of several known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and previous attacks associated with UAVs and aircraft's core communication systems. Analyzing current solutions to each threat and incorporating early concepts for UAM, this paper then presents a basic cybersecurity framework featuring a blockchain-based PKI with secondary navigation systems to allow for the development of secure airspace. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, the effect of humans safety-producing behavior on the overall resilience of the system is often neglected. Additionally, emerging aviation markets are giving rise to concepts of operation, such as urban air mobility and optionally piloted air cargo operations, that are leading to a shift in locus of control between humans and automation. Without an understanding of the human contribution to safety, it is difficult to assess the effects of these novel role allocations on overall system safety. In this work, safety-producing behaviors are identified and abstracted into resilient performance strategies. Production rules that encapsulate these strategies are then generated and classified in the Soar cognitive architecture. The strategies are then applied to a remotely-operated air cargo example to demonstrate how safe learning is facilitated. The learned rules and strategies are then formally verified. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All Rights Reserved.;3

It is likely that the first generation designs will be highly-augmented vehicles operated by pilots who have less training than commercial airline pilots. As a result, there is a strong need for research on (i) stability and control characteristics of these configurations, (ii) development of flight control systems aimed at Simplified Vehicle Operations, and (iii) interactions of pilots with the flight control and other vehicle systems. This paper discusses the design of a Total Energy Control System and Total Heading Control System for a lift-plus-cruise Urban Air Mobility vehicle concept. Both inner and outer loop control design are discussed for the vehicles entire flight regime, with a focus on achieving seamless transition between vertical and forward flight modes without adding to pilot workload.

This concept has the potential to mitigate ground-based congestion and improve transportation efficiency. To ensure the safety of UAM operations, the airborne navigation system must provide accurate and reliable navigation information. However, the design of such navigation systems remains not fully addressed in prior studies. Accordingly, this paper firstly presents a high-accuracy navigation system that employs Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)/ Inertial Navigation System (INS) tight integration and exploits differential GNSS corrections. Then, to protect against the potential measurement faults caused by complex signal reflections in urban environments, an Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM) framework is developed by applying multiple hypotheses solution separation to the Kalman filter-based integration architecture. This framework offers two capabilities of essential importance to ensuring safe UAM operations: real-time fault detection and rigorous navigation integrity quantification. The proposed algorithms are validated by various simulations, and the results suggest promising performance. 2020, The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China.

Many countries worldwide are funding several researches to identify and develop enabling technologies to make urban air mobility as safe as modern aviation. One of the most critical aspect of those aeroplanes rely on the reduced fuselage dimensions and available space on board to welcome all those safety critical systems commonly used on commercial aviation. The air data system is one of the safety critical system that is equipped with several probes and vanes, protruding externally from the aircraft fuselage, and some of its functionalities are adequately redundant for general aviation and large aeroplanes. Even though an airworthiness standard applicable to urban air mobility is not ready yet, worldwide there are several efforts that will lead to type certification standards in next years. This work presents a brief survey of certified technologies available for sensing solutions feeding air data systems and solutions based on synthetic sensors certifiable in a couple of years. The survey relies on certified and certifiable innovative data sensing units for realistic urban air mobility applications. To this aim, a safety assessment analysis is presented in order to support the validity of the certifiable air data sensing solutions presented in this paper. 2020 IEEE.;3

These applications require robust positioning, communciations, and time synchronization services. Legacy systems such as GPS provide these capabilities extremely well, but are sensitive to spoofing and hijacking cyberattacks. In a previous study, we developed a local GPS alternative that provides highly secure communications, positioning, and timing synchronization services to networks of cooperative RF users. In this study, we consider this Communications and High-Precision Positioning (CHP2) system in the context of safety-critical transport applications and urban air mobility. We demonstrate rapid (< 100 ms) and precise (< 1cm) positioning capabilities in over-the-air experiments using flexible ground stations and UAS platforms using limited bandwidth (10 MhZ). We compare several position estimation algorithms in simulation and experimental test environments to identify suitable approaches for different applications. We discuss how the integrated communications link secures the system from spoofing and hijacking cyberattacks. We assert that the these capabilities make CHP2 a suitable candidate to provide both communications, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) and alternative positioning, navigation, and timing (APNT) services for safety-critical transport applications on a variety of vehicular platforms. 2020 IEEE.;3

Although the passenger traffic will be mostly in and near urban environments, UAM is also being considered for air cargo, perhaps between cities. Such capability is pushing the current communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) / air traffic management (ATM) systems that were not designed to support these types of aviation scenarios. The UAM aircraft will be operating in a congested environment, where CNS and ATM systems need to provide integrity, robustness, security, and very high availability for safety of UAM operations while evolving. As UAM is under research by academia and government agencies, the industry is driving technology towards aircraft prototypes. Critical UAM requirements are derived from command and control (C2) (particularly for RPIC scenario), data connectivity for passengers and flight systems, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to UAS communication to avoid collision, and data exchange for positioning and surveillance. In this paper, we study connectivity challenges and present requirements towards a robust UAM architecture through its concept of operations. In addition, we review the existing/potential CNS technologies towards UAM, i.e., 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR), navigation detect avoid (DAA), and satellite systems and present conclusions on a future road-map for UAM CNS architecture. 2020 IEEE.;3

Extensive studies have focused on improving visual navigation accuracy and robustness in complex environment, while insufficient attention has been paid to ensuring navigation safety in the presence of outliers. From safety perspective, integrity is the most important navigation performance criterion because it measures the trust that can be placed in the correctness of the navigation output. Through leveraging the concept of integrity, this paper develops an integrity monitoring framework to protect visual navigation system against misleading measurements and to quantify the reliability of the navigation output. We firstly present the iterative least squares (LS)-based pose estimation algorithm and derive the associated covariance estimation methodology. Then we develop a two-layer fault detection scheme through combining random sampling consensus (RANSAC) with multiple hypotheses solution separation (MHSS) to achieve high efficiency and high reliability. Finally, the framework determines the probabilistic error bound of the navigation output that rigorously captures the undetected faults and the measurement uncertainty. The proposed algorithms are validated using various simulations, and the results suggest the promising performance. 2020, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.;3

Novel electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) concepts are needed to satisfy the demand presented by UAM. Stacked rotorstwo co-rotating rotors aligned coaxially, separated by an axial offset and azimuthal spacingare one such concept which have been shown to increase hover efficiency and decrease noise. Adjustment of azimuthal spacing mid-flight through electronic phasing presents a new method for thrust control. The goals of this paper are to experimentally determine the axial and azimuthal spacings for best hover efficiency and validate the thrust control authority of azimuthal spacing variation. Experiments of a 1.108 m-radius stacked rotor with various axial and azimuthal spacings were performed in hover and compared at constant power and constant collective. Significant effects of axial and azimuthal spacing on rotor performance were revealed. Configurations were determined which improved thrust by 5% at constant power compared to a single, four-bladed rotor and varied thrust by 19.65% through an azimuthal spacing change of 39.375 at constant collective.

10.2514/6.2020-3210;2020;A.+Das K.+Marotta H.+Idris;Aegis: Autonomous Entity Global Intelligence System For Urban Air Mobility;This paper presents a global intelligence system that synthesizes aerial vehicles real-time physical data, planned actions, and historical behavior into engineered data frames representing the collective state of the airspace and suitable for efficient machine learning consumption. These data frames are then learnt by a deep neural net to build a prediction model that estimates the expected evolution path of the current state, thereby identifying potential future conflicts. This approach lends itself to an automated early warning system that the aerial vehicles can implement onboard with a suitable edge computing module more efficiently and effectively than non-AI methods, and eventually take preventive or corrective measures towards self/collaborative resolution of the issues. Contrary to a centralized early warning system where all vehicles task-space eventually converges to a global optimum state, the presented distributed global intelligence system brings in a balance between local utility functions of each vehicle and the global operating framework. This contributes to effectively handle the potential massive scaling in urban air mobility in the near future. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-3004;2019;B.+P.+Pollard M.+D.+Patterson S.+K.+S.+Whiteside;A Combined Blade Element And Vortex Panel Method For Stacked Rotor Analysis;The growing interest in urban air mobility (UAM) is driving researchers to investigate novel propulsion system technologies that can provide the characteristics required to realize practical UAM aircraft. One such propulsion technology that has potential to increase efficiency and reduce noise is stacked rotors. Stacked rotors consist of multiple co-rotating rotors positioned co-axially with a small axial offset. The literature indicates that the wake-to-blade, blade-to-wake, and blade-to-blade interactions contribute significantly to the overall rotor performance. The complex interactions between wakes and blades are difficult to model theoretically without using high-fidelity tools, such as computational fluid dynamics codes, which are computationally expensive thus limited in their use for design. In an attempt to obtain a computationally efficient analysis of stacked rotor performance for use in early phase design, we develop a new method that combines a 2D panel method with blade element theory to estimate the performance of stacked rotors/propellers. When comparing our method to experimental results, the largest discrepancy for the lower rotor was an overprediction of thrust coefficient by 7.5%, while the largest discrepancy for the upper rotor was an underprediction of thrust coefficient by 15.7%. Our predictions somewhat follow the experimental trends in thrust coefficient. We have identified a clear pathway for future development and improvements to the method. 2019 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. All rights reserved.;3

UAM comprises a range of services that unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) could provide in densely populated cities, MVP provides a means of moving this service into the market while managing financial risk. Our approach identified candidate missions, selected the mission most suitable as an MVP, defined that reference mission to support further analysis, analyzed requirements, barriers, and challenges to commercial viability of the MVP, developed the business case, assessed pros and cons from the perspective of multiple stakeholders, and formulated a safety case. Our selected MVP use case was medical package delivery, a mission conducted using small UAS (<55 lb) vehicles that can accommodate a payload of up to 5 lb. Ensuring safety is the main challenge for implementation of the MVP. Our safety case applied a process developed by an international group of experts from national and regional aviation safety organizations. The analysis identified potential sources of ground risk (harm to persons on the ground) and air risk (collisions in the air), as well as potential mitigations to reduce the risks to acceptable levels. MVP implementation will also require significant initial investments, and the operations are not expected to be profitable for a few years. The cost of UAS package delivery will have to be close to that of existing services, though the advantages of speed and spontaneity for deliveries by UAS will allow some price premium. We see noise and perceived safety as the major barriers to public acceptance, and these will have to be addressed by demonstrating acceptable noise levels and a record of safe UAS operations. Although these needs represent significant barriers, our analysis concludes that they can be overcome with existing or near-term air vehicles, technologies, market demand, and operational procedures. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-3125;2019;P.+D.+Vascik R.+J.+Hansman;Assessing Integration Between Emerging And Conventional Operations In Urban Airspace;This paper investigates the use of low altitude airspace by conventional flight operations in proximity to the San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta international airports. The purpose of the investigation is two-fold. First, the study presents an approach to develop lateral and vertical containment boundaries for arrival and departure flight trajectories. The boundaries describe the extent of the airspace actively used to support the flights. Second, the study develops containment boundaries for large transport aircraft operations at the three airports to demonstrate how these conventional operations may influence where and when emerging Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or Urban Air Mobility (UAM) networks may operate. 180 days of ASDE-X radar tracking data were analyzed to determine the location and traffic density of large transport aircraft, helicopters, and four other classes of operators. The flight trajectories for each operator class were sorted into arrivals, departures, and missed approaches to or from each runway. Containment boundaries were first developed for transport aircraft with greater than 100 passenger seats. Airspace that remained outside the containment boundary could potentially support simultaneous but non-interfering UAS or UAM operations. Variations in containment size due to airport-specific attributes were investigated. Containment boundary expansion to accommodate regional and commuter aircraft operations was assessed. Finally, airport access for UAM or UAS operators based upon conventional flight operations was considered. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;3

It assesses the extent to which the UAM operations will trigger TCAS resolution advisories (RA) aboard the conventional aircraft in the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) terminal airspace. It is observed that under deterministic UAM operational conditions, no RAs will be triggered. Furthermore, the impact of UAM altitude uncertainty is also evaluated. It is observed that restricting the UAM cruise altitudes to 990 feet above Mean Sea Level (MSL) or below reduced the chance of triggering an RA to under five percent throughout the day, even in the presence of maximum altitude error of 30 feet. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2019;J.+Ko J.+Kim S.+Lee;Computational Study Of Wake Interaction And Aeroacoustic Characteristics In Multirotor Configurations;Multirotor configurations such as VTOL and urban air mobility have been focused on today due to the high maneuverability. Aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics of multirotor have much difference to those of a single rotor. In this study, a numerical analysis based on the free wake vortex lattice method is used for identifying the wake interaction effect. In order to compare the various configurations and operating conditions, the effects of the spacing between the rotors in hovering flight and the effects of the advancing ratio and the formation in forward flight are discussed. Aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics are significantly affected by the wake interaction. In the hovering flight, the unsteady loading of multirotor changes periodically and loading fluctuation increases as decreasing the spacing. It causes the variation in unsteady loading noise and the noise directivity pattern. In the forward flight, the difference in loading fluctuation and noise characteristics are observed according to the diamond and square formation of rotors. By comparing with results which obtained by using single rotor analysis for multirotor configurations, multirotor has different directivity pattern according to the location of each rotor. As a result, wake interaction effect becomes a highly important factor for aeroacoustic analysis according to multirotor configurations and operating conditions.

N/A;2019;P.+D.+Vascik V.+Bulusu J.+Cho V.+Polishchuk;A Geometric Approach Towards Airspace Assessment For Emerging Operations;Emerging Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operators propose to introduce extensive flight networks into metropolitan airspace. However, this airspace currently contains complex legacy airspace constructs and flight operations that are perceived as safe, efficient, and generally acceptable to the overflown public. Hence, Air Traffic Management (ATM) concepts to support UAM may be constrained to cause little to no interference with these legacy operations. The identification of airspace that is non-interfering and potentially available to these new operators is therefore a critical first step to support UAM integration. This paper introduces a geometric airspace assessment approach that considers seven existing airspace constructs. Four hypothetical ATM scenarios are developed that prescribe different degrees of UAM integration. An alpha-shape topological method is refined to process geometrically complex airspace construct polygons over an expansive geographic area and develop 3D mappings of airspace availability. The approach is demonstrated in the San Francisco Bay Area and is readily extensible to other locations. It is envisioned to be useful in identification of viable takeoff and landing sites, evaluation of the sensitivity of airspace availability to separation or trajectory conformance requirements, and flight route design, throughput estimation and risk analysis. 2019 EUROCONTROL.

This paper presents a proposed anti-phase rotor technology that could reduce noise sources such as blade vortex interaction noise. The anti-phase rotor technology includes a rotor design with various anti-phase alternating trailing edge patterns and a rotor design with an asymmetric blade tip. Four small-scale anti-phase rotors are fabricated by 3D printing for acoustic measurements conducted in a low-speed open-circuit wind tunnel to assess the effectiveness of the proposed anti-phase rotor technology. Preliminary test results appear to be promising and indicate that the anti-phase rotor designs could be a practical means of reducing blade vortex interactions and noise. The four tested anti-phase rotor designs have peak acoustic performance depending on the RPM and thrust which suggests improved performance through design optimization could be achieved for specific mission requirements. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The interaction of component wakes leads to a series of unique handling qualities and performance problems that jeopardize mission suitability. Because of technical issues related to cost and applicability of CFD methods, aircraft design approaches often ignore physics-based numerical methods in favor of fast heuristic and empirically tuned models, which results in an expensive trial-and-error approach to fuselage/empennage development. This paper documents a recent effort to develop a new class of CFD-based interactional aerodynamics solvers for comprehensive analysis/design of complete aircraft configurations that directly addresses the inability of contemporary design approaches to account for interactional aerodynamics, while retaining the computational efficiency needed for routine design and analysis work. The approach employs a novel grid-based vorticity-velocity CFD solver for the fully unsteady 3D flow around the aircraft coupled to a variety of surface element descriptions of the rotating blades, wings and airframes. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Energy-efficient distributed propulsion, vertical take-off and landing capabilities and reduced emissions are some examples of the great possibilities that electric propulsion offers and how it could disrupt air travel and urban air mobility in the future. Next to the many technological challenges associated with such new concepts, important regulatory barriers still need to be overcome to make it come true. One aspect of particular attention is the impact on environmental noise. In this paper, the acoustic performance of two all-electric light aircrafts is assessed based on ground and in-flight measurements. The investigated aircrafts are the Magnus eFusion, first all-electric aerobatic training airplane in the world and the Extra 330LE, world's first electric aircraft to tow a glider into the sky. For both airplanes, the actual impact of electric propulsion on exterior radiated noise during fly-over is quantified - for the first time - using two variants of the same aircraft, equipped with two different propulsion systems: in one case with a conventional piston engine, in the other case with an electric motor. Cabin noise is also assessed for the two aircraft variants. Sound quality metrics as well as sound source localization techniques are used to perform a detailed analysis of the interior and exterior aircraft noise and to get insight into the noise generation mechanisms. The manuscript details the complete set of measurement techniques which are available for acoustic engineers to develop quieter electric aircrafts in the future. It reports about the setup and execution of the test campaign, it describes the processing of the acquired data and discusses the major findings. Results highlight the different footprints of the two types of propulsion in terms of fly-over and cabin interior noise levels. 2018 AIAA.;3

A key challenge for the success of UAM is how to manage large-scale autonomous flight operations with safety guarantee in high-density, dynamic and uncertain airspace environments. In this paper, a safety assured decentralized online guidance algorithm with airborne self-separation capability is proposed and analyzed for multi-aircraft autonomous flight operations under uncertainties. The problem is formulated as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process with continuous action space and is solved by a customized decentralized online algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To guarantee the safety of real-time autonomous flight operations in uncertain environments, the formulation of loss of chance constrained separation is introduced and integrated with the proposed MCTS algorithm. In addition, Gaussian process regression along with Bayesian optimization is employed to discretize the continuous action space, which helps shorten the flight time. A comprehensive numerical study shows that the proposed algorithm can provide safe onboard guidance with guaranteed low near mid-air collision probability in uncertain and high-density airspace environments. 2000-2011 IEEE.;2

In order for UAM to be successfully integrated into the current urban transportation system, user experience (UX) considerations need to be explored. However, few studies have revealed the understanding of user needs and requirements from the perspective of transportation experience. In this regard, our research team conducted workshops with vehicle experts to explore important UX considerations for UAM usage according to the initial and mature phases of UAM operations. Also, we uncovered UAM usage motives, potential use cases, as well as three expected forms of UAM operations. The findings from this study contribute to providing insights and design guidelines for UAM UX developers in future urban contexts. 2022 ACM.;2

Typically, strategic UTM involves solving an optimization problem that ensures that proposed flight schedules do not exceed airspace and vertiport capacities. However, the dynamic nature and low lead-time of applications such as on-demand delivery and urban air mobility traffic may reduce the efficiency and fairness of strategic UTM. We first discuss the adaptation of three fairness metrics into a traffic flow management problem (TFMP). Then, with computational simulations of a drone package delivery scenario in Toulouse, we evaluate trade-offs in the TFMP between efficiency and fairness, as well as between different fairness metrics. We show that system fairness can be improved with little loss in efficiency. We also consider two approaches to the integrated scheduling of both high lead-time flights (i.e., flights with a schedule known in advance) and low lead-time flights in a rolling horizon optimization framework. We compare the performance of both approaches for different horizon lengths and under varying proportions of high and low lead-time flights. 2021, Deutsches Zentrum fr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.;2

However, while nearly everyone is familiar with commercial airline operations and assume they are safe, UAMs remain a nascent product that have yet to be widely understood by the public. In this study, we identify factors that might affect the flying public's choice of vertiports and air taxis. Methods: We sampled 1125 people from the United States and India. In stage 1, participants were asked to identify concerns regarding vertiports and UAMs. In stage 2, they were asked to rate the importance of each concern. Results: We found that potential passengers are primarily concerned about UAM safety and security, both for vertiports and UAMs. Convenience items also appeared, but were generally rated as less important than safety and security items. Discussion: Future vertiport and air taxi developers will benefit from a better understanding of potential passengers concerns. Messaging should include education about how safety and security is ensured for both UAMs and vertiports. 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society;2

To be successful, it will require an integrated approach able to balance efficiency and safety while leveraging common resources and information. In this work we focus on future urban air-taxi services, and present the first methods and algorithms to efficiently operate air-taxi at scale. Our approach is twofold. First, we use a passenger-centric perspective which introduces traveling classes, and information sharing between transport modes to differentiate quality of services. This helps smooth multimodal journeys and increase passenger satisfaction. Second, we provide a flight routing and recharging solution which minimizes direct operational costs while preserving long term battery life through reduced energy-intense recharging. Our methods, which surpass the performance of a general state-of-the-art commercial solver, are also used to gain meaningful insights on the design space of the air-taxi problem, including solutions to hidden fairness issues. 2021;2
N/A;2022;A.+Stoll J.+Bevirt;Development Of Evtol Aircraft For Urban Air Mobility At Joby Aviation;Typical existing VTOL aircraft-notably, helicopters-are limited in their suitability to civil transportation due to high operating costs, high noise levels, and safety levels below other forms of commercial aviation. Modern electric propulsion technology offers potential solutions to these drawbacks and potentially allows for practical VTOL aircraft configurations less compromised than traditional solutions. Through a multiyear study of various configurations, Joby selected the tilt-propeller as the optimal approach to safely achieve relatively high speed, long range, and low noise in urban air mobility operations. Full-scale flight testing began with a demonstrator phase, demonstrating successful transition between thrustborne and wingborne flight in 2017, and proceeded to a pre-production prototype phase, demonstrating high performance, including a 249 km (134 nm) VTOL flight and a true airspeed of over 322 km/h (174 kt), as well as low noise, measuring 45 dB(A) at 500 m (1,640 ft) equivalent in flyover and under 65 dB(A) at 100 m (328 ft) equivalent in hover.

N/A;2022;S.+K.+S.+Whiteside B.+P.+Pollard;Conceptual Design Of A Tiltduct Reference Vehicle For Urban Air Mobility;NASA is establishing a fleet of conceptual air vehicle designs to support research and development for Urban Air Mobility (UAM). This fleet of vehicles will enable examination of the sensitivity of UAM vehicle designs to technology assumptions, identify key research and development needs for UAM aircraft, and provide the UAM community with reference vehicles that are publicly available and based upon known assumptions. To date, five six-passenger UAM reference vehicles have been published: a single-main-rotor helicopter, a side-by-side helicopter, a quadrotor, a lift-plus-cruise, and a tiltwing. To increase the breadth of vehicle technologies encapsulated in the fleet of NASA UAM reference vehicles, this paper establishes a tiltduct vehicle as an addition to the fleet. The fleet will continue to evolve as future analyses and trade studies are performed. The tiltduct UAM reference vehicle has six tilting ducted proprotors. This paper describes the initial configuration downselection, discusses ducted proprotor design rules of thumb as they applied to the conceptual design of the reference vehicle, describes the vehicle sizing, trade studies, and tuning of models performed, and finally, compares the resulting tiltduct vehicle against the other six-passenger NASA UAM reference vehicles. The high-level analyses performed for this study did not indicate significant differences in performance between the tiltduct and tiltwing reference vehicles, and so vehicle performance alone may not be a key driver in the selection of a tiltduct vehicle over a tiltwing vehicle. However, if ducts are found to have significant acoustical benefits, then acoustical priorities may provide a compelling reason to incorporate ducted proprotors. One significant limitation of the design presented in this paper is that the ducted proprotor performance was tuned based upon performance characteristics observed during historical tests with disk loadings (defined as thrust divided by proprotor disk area) of 125-250 lb/ft2. The tiltduct vehicle designed in this study has a disk loading of 30 lb/ft2, to be more representative of UAM vehicles, further studies to understand performance of ducted proprotors at representative disk loadings are warranted.

This has led to efforts that aim to model the interactional aerodynamics of rotors operating in close proximity and its impact on performance. While computational fluid dynamics can accurately characterize the physics of multirotor interaction, in most cases it is too computationally demanding for performing studies over a range of parameters. On the other hand, lower-fidelity models approximate the underlying physics and are computationally inexpensive, but are often imprecise in predicting the fields of interest. In this study, we present a multifidelity approach that inherits the accuracy of a high-fidelity method, while retaining the computational efficiency of a low-fidelity model. With this approach, the low-fidelity model is used to span the entire space of parameters and identify key parameter values to perform high-fidelity simulations. A few selected high-fidelity simulations performed at these parameter values are then used in a lifting procedure to determine multifidelity solutions at other parameter values. In this paper we apply this strategy to determine the lift and drag distributions of a two-rotor assembly as a function of the longitudinal and vertical distance between them. We conclude that this strategy can substantially improve upon the low-fidelity results. 2022, AIAA International. All rights reserved.;2

In UAM environments, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are used to transport passengers and goods providing various convenient services such as package delivery, air bus, and air taxi. However, UAVs communicate with ground infrastructures through open channels that can be exposed to various security attacks. Therefore, a secure mutual authentication scheme is necessary for UAM environments. Moreover, a handover authentication is also necessary to ensure seamless communication when the service location is changed. In this paper, we design a secure and efficient handover authentication scheme for UAM environments considering various security vulnerabilities and efficiency using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). We utilize informal security analysis, Real-or-Random (RoR), Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) to prove the security of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, we compare the computation and communication cost comparisons of the proposed scheme with the other related schemes.

A flow analysis was conducted via simulations based on actuator disk method. The parameters analyzed included the number of propellers, rotating direction, and propeller interval. An increment in the number of propellers increased the wing lift and drag, in addition to the propeller thrust and power. Although the lift-to-drag ratio decreased, the ratio of the wing lift to the propeller power increased. The lift and lift-to-drag ratio of the co-rotating systems were larger than those of the counter rotating systems, however, the lift-to-drag ratio of the latter exceeded that of the former when the number of propellers was seven. An increment in the required thrust increased the lift-to-drag ratio of the counter rotating system in comparison with that of the co-rotating system. Configuration with propellers concentrated at the wing tip increased the lift and drag. However, when the tip propeller was fixed at the wing tip, with the other propellers concentrated in the vicinity of the wing center, the lift increased more, while the drag decreased. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.;2

The edgewise flight conditions included four tip Mach numbers, three freestream velocities, and two disk incidence angles representing realistic flight conditions for an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicle. Forces were measured with a 6-axis load cell and far-field noise was measured with 1/4 in free-field microphones at 175 locations around the rotor. The tonal and broadband noise contributions were separated and analyzed in both the frequency and time domains. The mean thrust coefficient and torque coefficient were found to be proportional to the advance ratio squared. The sound pressure level (SPL) at the blade pass frequency (BPF) and the overall SPL (OASPL) increased for both increasing tip Mach number and increasing freestream velocity. The directivity of the noise displayed a dependency on advance ratio with a peak SPL below the retreating side. This mimics the unsteady loading noise directivity for a low tip speed rotor in edgewise flight. The broadband noise had a dipole directivity with a minimum in the rotor plane. The low/mid frequency broadband noise below 30 times the BPF had time signatures indicative of blade wake interaction noise, while the high frequency noise above 30 times the BPF had time signatures and directivities indicative of trailing edge noise. These results demonstrate the importance of unsteady noise sources for an isolated UAM rotor in edgewise flight. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.;2

Under the urban air mobility (UAM) concept, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft can use the third dimension of the urban space for various transportation needs. However, the energy required to complete an UAM mission by an eVTOL vehicle must be less than the available energy stored in the battery pack. Furthermore, eVTOL vehicles must fly along the feasible paths, such as avoiding collisions with any obstacles to arrive at the destination vertiport safely. The objective of this paper is to develop a convex optimization approach for the trajectory optimization of a multi-phase eVTOL mission, including cruise, descent, and landing under various operational constraints in real time.

10.2514/6.2022-2166;2022;J.+A.+Valdez C.+E.+Tinney;The Unsteady Wake Produced By A Coaxial Co-Rotating Rotor In Hover;In a recent article by Tinney and Valdez (2020, AIAA J. vol. 58, no. 4), the trade space between near-field acoustics and thrust produced by a laboratory-scale, coaxial, co-rotating rotor in hover was investigated experimentally. The study considered the effect of various index angles and stacking distances between the upper and lower rotor for a range of rotor speeds and was motivated by growing interests in the use of stacked rotors for urban air mobility applications. It was reported how stacking distance was less significant at affecting acoustics and thrust and that the primary variable was the index angle between the upper and lower rotors. An analysis of the first few blade pass frequency harmonics demonstrated how the same thrust coefficient can be achieved with different rotor speed index angles and stacking distances, all the while producing uniquely different sound levels in as much as 15 dB(A). The current focus is a follow up campaign employing high-speed digital schlieren system and a single camera PIV system to measure the flowfield produced by the same stacked rotor as it relates to the performance trade space presented by Tinney and Valdez (2020).7 PIV measurements quantify the evolutionary behavior of the blade tip vortices produced by the upper and lower rotors, and their interactions for various index angles and wake ages for a given rotor speed. Vortex tracking methods quantify the anisotropic wandering motions of the blade tip vortices and reveal patterns that are unique to both the upper and lower rotors. The findings reinforce the notion that the optimal index angle for the thrust produced by a coaxial, co-rotating rotor is one where the blade tip vortices produced by the upper rotor graze the low pressure side of the lower rotor. If the miss distance is too small, collisions between the upper rotor vortex and the lower rotor ensue and any gains in thrust are compounded by noise penalties. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

From these results we identify variation of UAM demand with changing DOC and prove that UAM demand is closely tied to Metropolitan demand profile and aerodrome network characteristics. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

The net impact of this is investigated as a function of battery technology and trip distance. The aircraft is sized and analyzed using the Parametric Energy-based Aircraft Configuration Evaluator, a sizing framework utilizing a parametric geometry definition and resizing rule-set for the aircraft, strip theory-based aero-propulsive models, energy-based mission performance analysis, and a combination of empirical and physics-based mass properties analyses. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

10.22266/IJIES2022.0228.44;2022;N.+S.+Kim;Link Balance And Performance Of Uam In Noma-Based Cellular Networks;Recently, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, which transmits multiple users in the same time-frequency block, has been focused on for future cellular networks. Conventional NOMA-based aerial cellular networks consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an aerial user, in which secure control information for UAV is important. In recent days, the deployment of urban air mobility (UAM) has been actively discussed for a new aerial transport service in an urban area. Since UAM conveys passengers, both the traffic and the control information for passengers and a vehicle are important. Therefore, this paper considers a NOMA-based aerial cellular network with a UAM as an aerial user and a ground user as a terrestrial user. And we derive closed-form outage probabilities of the forward and reverse links of UAM, and the Monet-Carlo simulation verifies the results. Further, the condition to maintain the balance between the forward and the reverse links for the identical quality of service (QoS) is derived. Numerical results show that the outage probability of the forward link decreases with the increase of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, we noticed that the outage probability of the reverse link shows the error floor, which does not decrease with the received SNR and remains constant, caused by the interference from the ground user (GU). Also, it is shown that there is an average transmit power of UAM to conform the link balance regardless of strong or weak users. 2022, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

10.2514/6.2022-0889;2022;D.+G.+Mitchell D.+H.+Klyde M.+W.+Shubert D.+Sizoo R.+Schaller;Testing For Certification Of Urban Air Mobility Vehicles;Urban Air Mobility represents a revolution in air travel. Novel aircraft designs, combined with increasingly complex levels of automation, will provide opportunities for quick and convenient commuter and air taxi service at an affordable price. As aircraft are introduced that look little like those with which we are familiar, blending elements of vertical and short takeoff-and-landing capability with conventional wingborne flight, civil certification will become more and more challenging. Adding to the challenge will be the increasing use of autonomous control, to the extent that future aircraft will be pilotless. Certification testing of such designs requires not only a thorough understanding of the flight characteristics of the basic vehicle, but an appreciation for the range of possible paths that can be adopted by highly augmented and autonomous control systems. This paper reviews the challenges in certification and discusses three levels of sophistication in the process, matching design steps that are employed in modern aircraft design: analysis, simulation, and flight test. We will suggest that designers of modern aircraft be allowed to apply each of those design steps throughout the certification cycle. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

One promising but only little investigated and understood subcategory comprises tilt-wing eVTOLs. They offer high efficiency and long flight ranges but come with a trade-off in increased complexity. Consequently, a critical step towards market entry is the development of mature and safe hybrid pilot-autonomy control systems, including fault detection, identification, and recovery (FDIR) concepts. That requires a mid-fidelity dynamic model with sufficient accuracy, which is not yet available despite a long history of tilt-wing research. Without a representative model, no detailed analysis and identification of a trimmed transition trajectory could be performed. This, however, is a crucial step in the development of a control system. We approach the problem by applying and combining current modeling approaches. Furthermore, a trim analysis of different flight phases, including the transition, is conducted. The identified model lays the foundation for a representative and detailed development and investigation of future control designs, bringing tilt-wing eVTOLs closer to airworthiness. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.3390/en15020638;2022;T.+Donateo A.+Ficarella;A Methodology For The Comparative Analysis Of Hybrid Electric And All-Electric Power Systems For Urban Air Mobility;The present investigation addresses the topic of Urban Air Mobility with particular reference to the air-taxi service with electrified power systems. A new and detailed methodology is proposed for the simplified design and energy analysis of conventional, hybrid-electric, and full-electric power systems for this application. The original contributions to the scientific literature on UAM are the detailed modeling approach, the evaluation of CO2 emissions with a Well-to-Wing approach as a function of the electricity Emission Intensity factor, and the comparison with road vehicles performing the same route in different driving conditions. The comparison demonstrates the advantages of a full electric air-taxi with todays technology versus a hybrid-electric road taxi, especially in cases involving low emission intensity and unfavorable driving conditions (congested traffic, aggressive driving style, and high circuity factor values). In the case of 2035 technology, the comparison with a referenced fully electric road vehicle is detrimental to the air taxi but the values of Well-to-Wheel/Wing CO2 with the expected Emission Intensity of 90 g/kWe for the European Union are still quite low (67 g/km). The investigation also quantifies the negative effect of battery aging on the consumption of the air taxi and on the number of consecutive flights that can be performed without fully charging the battery. 2022 by the authors.

Considering electric cars as well as electric passenger drones, often referred to as UAM (urban air mobility), we use an urban spatial computable general equilibrium model to assess the welfare and environmental impacts of a transition to electric mobility. A numerical simulation of the model shows that a transition from gasoline to electric cars yields major emission reductions, while leading to welfare losses due to tax-induced market distortions. Introducing UAM into a gasoline-car city leads to marginal overall welfare gains. Introducing UAM into a city with electric cars results in welfare losses. While introducing UAM as an alternative to gasoline cars decreases CO2 emissions, the introduction of UAM as alternative to electric cars leads to increasing emissions. 2021 The Author(s);2

It is fascinating because ester bonds in the suberin can be easily hydrolyzed to provide various functional chemical precursors for further applications. This study investigates an unprecedented way to tailor energy-absorbing capabilities in silica-reinforced styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) composites by introducing depolymerized suberin derivatives (DSDs) extracted from cork and potato periderm. The fillermatrix couplings were experimentally and analytically investigated through dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and the HuberVilgis model. The DSDs modified silicapolymer interfaces seem to offer a substantial increase in strength, toughness, and energy-absorption by nearly 47 %, 336 %, and 126 %, respectively, compared to bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)-tetrasulfide (TESPT)-coupled elastomers, without sacrificing the modulus. These findings could inspire natural materials enabled composite design for high energy-absorbing materials and provide a breakthrough in utilizing natural resources for next-generation structures such as urban air mobility or autonomous electrical vehicle, which typically require multifunctional performances including lightweight, high strength, and energy-absorbing capability. 2021 Elsevier B.V.;2
10.1016/j.trc.2021.103274;2021;M.+C.+R.+Mura;Identification And Prediction Of Urban Airspace Availability For Emerging Air Mobility Operations;Emerging Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations are expected to introduce novel air traffic networks in metropolitan areas in order to provide on-demand air transportation services and alleviate ground congestion. Yet, metropolitan regions are typically characterized by complex and dense terminal airspace structure that accommodates arrival and departure traffic from large metroplex airports. Therefore, UAM operations are expected to be initially integrated into urban airspace without interfering with conventional operations and compromising current safety and efficiency levels. This paper presents a data-driven approach to identify and predict available urban airspace that is procedurally separated from conventional air traffic towards supporting UAM integration. We use historical aircraft tracking and meteorological data to learn the spatial distribution of air traffic in the terminal airspace and create a probabilistic traffic model to predict active traffic patterns and their spatial confidence regions given current operational conditions. We demonstrate the approach for the city of Sao Paulo and its closest commercial airport, Congonhas (CGH), in Brazil. The results show that leveraging the traffic flow dynamics to allocate the urban airspace dynamically is beneficial to increase UAM accessibility by more than 5% from 3000 ft. Moreover, airspace availability is found to be highly sensitive to the applied separation requirements, emphasizing the importance of leveraging advanced technologies to progressively make such requirements less stringent. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;2

The proposition of this research is to leverage a system of autonomous UAVs capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) to transport passengers and cargo between airports and defined destinations in different urban cities in the United States: Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Dallas. The study comprises of defining a standard set of metrics to consider, developing a system model for defined case studies, and performing tradespace analyses to quantifiably evaluate alternative ways of achieving the most desirable architecture outcomes. This study models and evaluates 1,620 enumerable architectures and analyzes numerous tradespaces to examine the correlation and interrelationships between decision variables and performance metrics. Among the metrics, this analysis focuses on the interrelationships between Annual Profit, Mean Time Between Incident (MTBI), Upfront Cost, and Passengers Shuttled Per Day. The resulting analysis ranks architectures on the True and Fuzzy Pareto Front that is used to determine essential and quasi-necessary features in relation to these interrelationships. Based on the various stakeholders and their unique needs, the model recommends Los Angeles as the pilot city and for the system to leverage a FIFO queuing system, a smartphone interface, and a hybrid energy source that utilizes electric energy. 2021;2

UAVs are mostly used during various operation tasks (military, scientific or civil), as search and rescue, disaster assessment, urban traffic monitoring, war zone defense monitoring, 3D mapping, archaeological site prospection, delivery of small packages and others. Estimation of features around the flight path and surveillance of areas where there is a high number of vehicles are of extreme importance for typical UAV missions. This paper focuses on a system capable of monitoring crowded areas or impervious sites, identifying a safety area for appropriate vertical landing or takeoff maneuver of the UAV with a high level of accuracy and robustness, even without using GNSS-derived navigation information, and with on-board terrain hazard detection and avoidance (DAA) capabilities. We propose a support control system for vertiport airspace design that must precede practical operations in the framework of urban air mobility (UAM). The system is composed by a mechanically rotating real-time LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) sensor, used for perception and localization (ranging) of obstacles in a surveillance volume, linked to a Raspberry Pi 3 as SBC (Session Board Controller), and interfaced to a GCS (Ground Control Station) by wireless connection for data management and 3D information transfer. 2021 IEEE.;2

The locations of vertiports were selected to operate urban air mobility (UAM) in the Seoul metropolitan area based on the population of commuters, and a noise priority route was created to minimize the number of people affected by noise using Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) software. Demand data were analyzed using survey data from the commuting population and were marked on a map using MATLAB. To cluster the data, the K-means algorithm function built in MATLAB was used to select the center of the cluster as the location of the vertiports, and the accuracy and reliability of the clustering were evaluated using silhouette techniques. The locations of the selected vertiports were also identified using satellite image maps to ensure that the location of the selected vertiports were suitable for the actual vertiport location, and if the location was not appropriate, final vertiports were selected through the repositioning process. A helicopter model was then used to analyze the amount of noise reduction achieved by the noise priority route, which is the route between the selected K-UAM vertiports compared to the shortest distance route. As a result, it was shown that the noise priority route that minimized the amount of noise exposure was more efficient than the business priority routes. 2021 by the authors.

UAM missions with complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements can be succinctly represented using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a behavioral specification language. However, planning and control of systems with STL specifications is computationally intensive, usually resulting in planning approaches that do not guarantee dynamical feasibility, or control approaches that cannot handle complex STL specifications. Here, we present an approach to co-design the planner and control such that a given STL specification (possibly over multiple UAV s) is satisfied with trajectories that are dynamically feasible and our controller can track them with a bounded tracking-error that the planner accounts for. The tracking controller is formulated for the non-linear dynamics of the individual UAVs, and the tracking error bound is computed for this controller when the trajectories satisfy some kinematic constraints. We also augment an existing multi-UAV STL-based trajectory generator in order to generate trajectories that satisfy such constraints. We show that this co-design allows for trajectories that satisfy a given STL specification, and are also dynamically feasible in the sense that they can be tracked with bounded error. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through simulations of multi- UAV missions. 2021 American Automatic Control Council.;2

In this paper, we study the problem of how to schedule urban air mobility trips when travel times are uncertain. Unlike in ground transportation, urban air mobility scheduling has to take into account that there is limited landing capacity at each destination, and for safety reasons, it must be guaranteed that an air vehicle will be able to land before it can be allowed to take off. We first present a network model for an on-demand urban air mobility service with uncertain travel times and limited landing capacity at nodes. For the practically relevant special case of one final destination and many origins, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a feasible schedule to exist for a given demand of flights. Next, we present a mixed integer program for obtaining an optimal schedule in this case. The paper concludes with a numerical study for a previously proposed urban air network in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. 2021 American Automatic Control Council.;2
10.3390/app11073127;2021;A.+Lerro M.+Battipede;Safety Analysis Of A Certifiable Air Data System Based On Synthetic Sensors For Flow Angle Estimation;This work deals with the safety analysis of an air data system (ADS) partially based on synthetic sensors. The ADS is designed for the small aircraft transportation (SAT) community and is suitable for future unmanned aerial vehicles and urban air mobility applications. The ADSs main innovation is based on estimation of the flow angles (angle-of-attack and angle-of-sideslip) using synthetic sensors instead of classical vanes (or sensors), whereas pressure and temperature are directly measured with Pitot and temperature probes. As the air data system is a safety-critical system, safety analyses are performed and the results are compared with the safety objectives required by the aircraft integrator. The present paper introduces the common aeronautical procedures for system safety assessment applied to a safety critical system partially based on synthetic sensors. The mean time between failures of ADSs sub-parts are estimated on a statistical basis in order to evaluate the failure rate of the ADSs functions. The proposed safety analysis is also useful in identifying the most critical air data system parts and sub-parts. Possible technological gaps to be filled to achieve the airworthiness safety objectives with nonredundant architectures are also identified. 2021 by the authors.;2

The proof-of-concept all-electric vehicle called SureFly was developed by Moog, Inc. A cooperative effort between NASA and Moog, Inc. has led to one of the first acoustic test datasets from an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicle being developed for passenger and cargo. Results show propeller and possibly motor tones are important for the overall noise levels. The vehicle has four support arms each with a pair of contra-rotating propellers. Noise measurements show higher noise levels from the lower propellers, likely due to inflow distortion from the arms and top propellers. Possible motor noise was identified by calculating harmonics of the line frequency and comparing to the tones in the narrowband acoustic spectra and phased microphone array data. The acoustic far field was found to be about 100 ft away from the vehicle, but additional microphones are needed to provide a better assessment. Results show the presence of modulation for some test conditions. The work reported here is only for ground tests. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.2514/6.2021-2333;2021;A.+Evans M.+Egorov S.+Campbell;Accommodating Operational Uncertainty In Urban Air Mobility Operations With Strategic Deconfliction;Strategic deconfliction is a key mechanism for achieving separation between Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations. However, operational uncertainties may degrade its effectiveness. In this paper, we quantify the effectiveness of strategic deconfliction in mitigating scheduled and unscheduled flight delays under operational uncertainty in the form of normally distributed departure and airborne errors. A range of demand levels representing early-stage UAM operations were simulated across a conceptual network of 3 vertiports in the San Francisco Bay Area. Three approaches to strategic deconfliction were simulated which varied the requirement for rescheduling into the existing schedule when an operation incurred departure or airborne error  a tight conformance requirement tied to the minimum spacing requirement, a relaxed conformance requirement comparable to that used for internal departure scheduling in Time-Based Flow Management, and no conformance requirement in which operations were never rescheduled into the existing scheduled  only replanned tactically. Results from these simulations were compared to a baseline that simulated tactical deconfliction without strategic deconfliction. Results suggest that departure and airborne delays under strategic deconfliction are highly sensitive to how much rescheduling is required into the existing schedule. Results applying strategic deconfliction with no conformance requirement, with departure and airborne error being accommodated tactically, showed significantly improved performance  even at relatively high demand and error variability. Future work should explore the safety and gaming implications of strategic deconfliction with such relaxed conformance requirements and compare its performance to using demand capacity balancing instead of strategic deconfliction. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

RANE v2 is developed as a part of multidisciplinary acoustic assessment of novel aircraft, namely, for vehicles within the Urban Air Mobility sector, in order to produce ground contours around airports and helipads. The model uses three-dimensional noise exposure surfaces around a series of discretised segments that represent the aircraft flightpath. The main inputs are the Noise Radius a function of the sources Sound Power Level (PWL) which come in the form of Noise-Power-Distance curves, and the source three-dimensional directivity. The directivity function may take analytical or numerical form, allowing for experimental data inputs. This paper demonstrates the use of Spherical Harmonics as a form of directivity function with a closed-form analytical proof for calculating the noise exposure contours. Preliminary results and comparison against the FAAs AEDT module for Helicopter Community Noise indicate that exposure contour coordinates may be estimated with little uncertainty. The incorporation of source directivity allows for the assessment of lateral attenuation, engine installation effects and transition operations (for vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa) via the assumption of individual source directivities and therefore complex noise surfaces. As a consequence of the analytical nature of the model, low computational requirements allows for fast exploration of the design space and parametric studies, with minimal input requirements. RANE v2 is currently being used to assess ground noise of two novel aircraft concepts, 1. a fixed wing fully electric General Aviation aircraft and 2. a Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) enabled rotorcraft. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

The analysis shows an integrated approach to establish UAM landing site requirements, place landing sites based on predicted demand, and estimate the costs associated with UAM landing sites. The method presented is applied to three large urban centers in the United States. The analysis assumes an all-electric, advanced multi-rotor aircraft with autonomous navigational and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities to estimate UAM landing site requirements. The paper presents the land area requirements of UAM landing sites using Federal Aviation Administration heliport design criteria considering ground-taxi configurations. The analysis performed employs a UAM vehicle with an equivalent Rotor Diameter (RD) of 43 feet. In this paper, a mode choice model developed in a companion study (On-Demand Mobility Scenario Analysis) estimates UAM demand. The methodology to locate UAM landing sites includes splitting and consolidating UAM landing sites considering the Zillow Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX) to introduce land-use size and cost constraints. The analysis splits and consolidates using K-means clustering and center of mass approach, respectively, where the demand of each landing site is analogous to mass. The results presented in this paper apply to 50 and 200 landing sites in each study area and assume a range of passenger Cost-Per-Mile (CPM). This paper presents a comparative study on how the number of landing sites and passenger Cost-per-Mile (CPM) affects the splitting, consolidation, and relocation of UAM landing sites for each study area, based on the availability of land. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2021-3204;2021;M.+Rimjha A.+Trani S.+Hotle;Urban Air Mobility: Preliminary Noise Analysis Of Commuter Operations;This study aims to estimate potential noise levels generated due to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) commuter operations in the Northern California and the Dallas-Fort Worth regions. UAM is a concept aerial transportation mode designed to bypass ground congestion using an electric vehicle with Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. UAM vehicles are expected to be significantly quieter than traditional helicopters, but operate on a much larger scale. Commuter travel demand will not be uniformly distributed with operations concentrated in a small geographical area such as Central Business Districts (CBD) and short time windows such as morning or evening peak periods. The objective of this study is to evaluate the aircraft noise annoyance generated by commuter UAM operations using flight trajectories developed in a previous study estimating UAM commuter demand. This study estimates the noise level from overflying UAM vehicles in a full day of operation (24 hours) and identifies areas where the noise levels may pose a challenge to future UAM operations. Noise estimation is performed at the Census Block group level using the Day-Night Level (DNL) metric. We run a parametric analysis considering two scenarios in each region: the UAM vehicle has a 10 dBA and 15 dBA noise reduction compared to the Robinson R-44 helicopter. The findings indicate a considerable difference between the 10 dBA and 15 dBA reduction scenarios. Although challenging, achieving a 15-dBA reduction compared to a 10-dBA reduction could reduce land area with DNL value above 50 dBA by 94% and highly-annoyed population by 91% in Northern California. Similarly, in Dallas-Fort Worth, achieving a 15-dBA reduction compared to a 10-dBA reduction could reduce the land area with DNL value above 50 dBA by 80% and a highly annoyed population by 85%. Lastly, we analyze the high-demand vertiport in the San Francisco Financial District in the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) to observe the DNL contours for the varying noise performance scenarios. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

However, current research shows that the society is still sceptical about air taxis. There are numerous factors influencing acceptance and willingness to use air taxis. One of them is a pleasant and comfortable cabin design. Within a user-centered-approach, this research investigates, what preferences people have on the interior design of future air taxis. For this purpose, a focus group study was conducted within the project HorizonUAM, including different demographic groups. On the one hand, a differentiation was made based on age, with a group of 18-39- year-olds and another of 40-65-year-olds participating. On the other hand, a distinction was made according to residential location in two additional groups. One group entailed small- and medium-town residents and the other group entailed metropolitans. In a first step, the participants were asked to name their requirements on vehicles and its cabin. In a second step, they were asked to develop a design concept for an air taxi cabin according to their preferences. The findings indicate, that the notion of air taxis meets the participants' basic transportation requirements like flexibility and short travel times. In terms of cabin design, aspects that are significant to all participants have been discovered. These include noise, windows and room temperature. However, in the design concepts of the individual groups the main emphasis differs. The group of the 18-39-year-olds emphasizes modern technologies and eco-friendliness. The 40-65-year-olds prefer a modular cabin-set-up. Residents from small- and medium-towns favor a cabin design, which includes different groups of people such as families or cyclists. Finally, metropolitans put their focus on individuality. Consequently, future cabin design concepts of air taxis should consider the identified preferences and requirements. 2021 IEEE.;2

UAS operations will face unique challenges in abiding by the same rules as manned aircraft. Approval paths and procedures are needed to ensure interoperability of UAS of various capabilities with each other, with air traffic management (ATM) and manned aircraft operators. A scalable process for Federal Aviation and Administration (FAA) approvals and oversight is required to meet the expected demand and increased complexity of UAS operations in the NAS. The approval process is the result of a series of FAA decisions to be captured in the products, rules, orders, circulars, procedures, and systems that support repeatability at the pace necessary to meet industry demand. New UAS operational concepts pose unique challenges from aircraft certification, operator certificate type for the scope of operation, crew composition, human-automation role, qualifications and training, and airspace operational limitations and requirements. In this paper, we will describe a decision identification framework (DIF), also referred to as the framework, that informs a repeatable process based on concept elements that characterize an operation. The framework organizes the decisions from low to high complexity to inform the approval process for operations, including night operations, operations over people (OOP), beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS), and small package delivery (SPD). These will lay the foundation for approving the most complex step, integrating multiple approved operations into the same airspace, which is a significant part of urban air mobility (UAM). The DIF is a work breakdown structure for creating the repeatable and scalable approval (RaSA) process. A detailed description of the approach to establishing a RaSA process for integrating UAS operations in the NAS is presented.

They present innumerable integration challenges, foremost among them pertaining to human automation roles and interactions. Both the FAA Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and NASA UAM CONOPS present incremental paths to fully integrated operations that assume initial operations are conducted using highly autonomous aircraft with a pilot on board using existing rules, regulations, systems, and infrastructure. In this paper we present an analysis framework to analyze the varying levels of automation as well as the human automation roles and interactions to achieve an adaptable, repeatable, and reusable process for approvals and oversight. Designing displays, systems and tools considering current and future needs will be not only beneficial but essential for integrated operations. 2021 IEEE.;2

Vertiports and Vertistops are single or multilanding spaces for air taxis, which are electric-powered vertical take-off and landing (eVTOLs) aircraft. The target of this paper is to apply a holistic approach how to design so called Verti-X in a holistic and system of system method from the Requirement-, Function-. Architecture- and the Implementation phase. The MAGIC approach contains all of the requierd phases which are necessary to build up such a complex design of Verti-X. Therefore, based on the literature survey, we have determined the key components of the Verti-X design with a thorough requirement analysis. Then, we have followed the existed criteria and regulations to design a valid and verified Verti-X which fulfills all the requirement. Furthermore, the focus of this paper is to apply the first four phases of MAGIC regarding the requirement, function, architecture and the implementation of such Verti-X Design.

This approach represents an interesting and efficient solution for the aeroacoustic characterization of electrically-powered propeller array, for which reliable and cost-efficient aeroacoustic models are still lacking, and the application of costly high-fidelity tools is mandatory. The numerical investigation focuses on surrogate models that take into account the effects of geometric parameters, such as propeller hubs relative positions and de-phasing, on the propeller array noise emissions. A well-known Artificial Neural Network metamodelling technique is applied on a numerical database obtained through a boundary integral formulation for the solution of incompressible potential flows around lifting/thrusting bodies, followed by the application of the Farassat 1A boundary integral formulation for the noise field evaluation. Due to the proposed non-standard application of the metamodelling technique applied, particular attention is paid to identifying the best strategy to exploit a database with a minimal number of samples with respect to those managed in the standard application of machine learning technique.

10.2514/6.2021-2349;2021;M.+Xue;Coordination Between Federated Scheduling And Conflict Resolution In Uam Operations;This work investigates two methods for coordination between scheduling and conflict resolution functions-two core traffic management functions in urban air mobility operations. A federated scheduling algorithm and a federated conflict resolution algorithm are first presented. Two methods for coordinating scheduling and conflict resolution functions are then introduced. The first coordination method utilizes the feedback from the arrival scheduler at the destination. The second method applies a flow interval, predefined to accommodate the capability of the conflict resolution, through the departure scheduler at the origin. High-density operation scenarios, where conflicts can not be completely resolved by the conflict resolution function alone, were used to study the performance of these two coordination methods. Experimental results show that both methods can perform well in coordinating scheduling and conflict resolution functions. With proper parameter setting, both methods can achieve similar performance in efficiency while achieving zero losses of separation. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar work, which through a mathematical definition of terms provides a foundation for describing the systems of the future: autonomous software-intensive systems and their architectures. Such systems include robotic taxi as an example of 2D mobility, or even drone/UAV taxi, as an example in the field of 3D urban air mobility. The presented terms lead to a four-level taxonomy.

10.1177/03611981211020005;2021;C.+Cummings H.+Mahmassani;Emergence Of 4-D System Fundamental Diagram In Urban Air Mobility Traffic Flow;Urban air mobility (UAM) is an emerging mode that promises to provide relief to congested urban streets. UAM relies on airspace, however, which is an exhaustible resource considering minimum aircraft separation requirements. In light of these requirements and UAM vehicle attributes, a simulation is developed to explore UAM traffic flows and congestion development. A decentralized conflict resolution scheme is employed in the form of a non-linear program (NLP) to offer improved flexibility in detours relative to past aircraft simulations. An expansion of Edies definitions of density and flow rate are used in conjunction with average speed to explore the relationships between traffic flow characteristics. The results find that UAM traffic flows emulate those of other modes, by following the familiar traffic patterns of build-up and breakdown captured in the macroscopic fundamental diagram. These findings also suggest the presence of a capacity of airspace that should be carefully managed by operators to achieve optimal system performance. The relationships established in this study highlight issues that UAM operators and aviation planners may face and could be used to improve the vehicle traffic modeling of other UAM models.

To adopt sustainable urban transport systems and contribute to the advancement of aerospace technology, the MOLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport) of South Korea has developed the K-UAM (Korea Urban Air Mobility) roadmap by collaborating with industries and academia to lead research and development related to the emerged industry. To guarantee the high reliability of industrial-level autonomous flights in urban areas, high priority should be provided to observe flight safety and survivability measures. This paper proposes adopting DNN (Deep Neural Network) based image processing for a vision-based safe landing region recognition framework to satisfy research and development needs. This framework is one of the core elements of the flight contingency plan for UAM and drone transportation in urban environments. Our proposed algorithm can recognize the coarse candidate region to land safely by using a DNN and then determine the refined safety zone by using the contour detection algorithm. To verify the performance of the proposed contribution, a simulation was done and the results were analyzed. The findings proved to be valid with regard to both the quantitative and qualitative terms. Therefore, our proposed framework will not only overcome the image processing complexity of the real world but also improve the enhancement of the flight emergency relief performance. ICROS 2021.;2
N/A;2021;Z.+Unal I.+Yavrucuk;Panel-Method-Based Path Planning For Evtol In Urban Environment;In this study the panel method used in fluid dynamics, is applied to the path planning problem of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles in urban environment. For an urban air mobility scenario the path planning problem of these vehicles includes the simultaneous operation of large number of vehicles around complex shaped buildings and architectural structures. Using the panel method, flow around complex shaped obstacles is modeled and calculated stream-lines of the fluid flow are used as trajectories for the eVTOL traffic. Since, streamlines do not cross each other or obstacles, using streamlines as vehicle trajectories guarantees collision free paths for vehicles. Moreover, source and sink elements are used to avoid collision of vehicles with each other in case of emergency, and attract the vehicles to target points. The application of panel method provides a solution to the whole path planning problem for multiple vehicles in a single step. Assuming complete knowledge of the city map, the path of each eVTOL vehicle in an air taxi fleet can be determined simultaneously. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

An Exploratory Empirical Analysis Of Public Perceptions In The United States;Due to recent technological advancements, flying cars are expected to be introduced in the near future, and to offer flexible mobility patterns, as well as shorter and more reliable travel times. This paper aims to analyse whether a residence relocation trend (from urban to rural areas, or vice versa) is imminent if flying cars are introduced.In this respect, responses of 584 individuals from the United States were collected through an online survey. The resulting data are statistically analysed through correlated grouped random parameters bivariate and univariate probit models, while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity.The analysis reveals that various socio-demographic characteristics and opinions of the individuals towards the perceived benefits and challenges of flying cars influence residence relocation consideration.The findings from this study offer early insights into the travel demand, land use, and urban and regional planning related challenges that may emerge from the future introduction of flying cars. 2021 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.;2
N/A;2021;H.+Cummings G.+Willink C.+Silva;Mechanical Design Of The Urban Air Mobility Side-By-Side Test Stand;The Urban Air Mobility Side-by-Side Test Stand (SBS) is a new capability for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to test the conceptual side-by-side rotorcraft configuration. This test stand enhances the experimental capabilities of the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project and is primarily designed to be tested in the U.S. Army's 7-by 10-Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. One of the goals for the SBS is to identify the optimal degree of rotor overlap that will yield the best aerodynamic performance. The SBS has two counter-rotating, intermeshing rotors that can vary in lateral separation. The test stand can pitch nose up and nose down, with each rotor having the capability to be trimmed independently through cyclic and collective controls. Six-axis load cells and rotary torque sensors are placed underneath each rotor to measure the thrust, torque, and side force from each rotor system. This paper describes the mechanical design of the SBS and outlines the structural analyses conducted to ensure a safety factor of 4 for ultimate strength and 3 for yield strength during all experimental testing. 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

N/A;2021;Z.+F.+Gan K.+S.+Brentner E.+Greenwood;Time Variation Of Rotor Broadband Noise;Rotor broadband noise studies typically analyze the broadband spectrum over a time scale on the order of the rotor period. However, since the time scale of turbulence generating the broadband noise is much smaller than the rotor period, it is physically-valid to construct a spectrum using a time period much less than the rotor period. The objective of this paper is to explore the importance of this unique viewpoint on rotor broadband noise prediction. Modulation of the blade self-noise spectrum during a blade passage or rotor period was observed for rotors in hover and forward flight-in both noise predictions and flight test data. Even for axisymmetric deterministic loading, modulation of the spectrum was still observed, due to convective amplification, retarded-time effects, and the blade position changes relative to the observer. Time variation of noise directivity was found to be dominant towards the advancing side of the rotor, and within 30 of the rotor disk plane. Overall, the time variation of the broadband self-noise spectrum was found to be important in the test cases, and is expected to be an important consideration for helicopters and urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft. 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

Such a system is evaluated in relevant Urban Air Mobility (UAM) passenger transport scenarios such as hovering in wind conditions and overcoming rotor failures. While conventional parallel axis multirotors are underactuated systems, the proposed mechanism makes the vehicle fully actuated in SE(3), which implies independent cabin position and orientation control. An accurate vehicle simulator with realistic parameters is presented to compare in simulation the proposed architecture with a conventional underactuated VTOL vehicle that shares the same physical properties. In order to make fair comparisons, controllers are obtained solving an optimization problem in which the cost function of both systems is chosen to be equivalent. In particular, the control laws are Linear-Quadratic Regulators (LQR), which are derived by linearizing the systems around hover. It is shown through extensive simulation that the introduction of a passive rotor tilting mechanism based on universal joints improves performance metrics such as vehicle stability, power consumption, passenger comfort and position tracking precision in nominal flight conditions and it does not compromise vehicle safety in rotor failure situations. 2013 IEEE.;2

The total signal received in a corner consists of four parts: (i) a direct signal from source to observer, (ii) a second signal reflected on the ground, (iii) a third signal reflected on the wall, (iv) a fourth signal reflected from both wall and ground. The problem is solved in two-dimensions to specify the total signal, whose ratio to the direct signal specifies the multipath factor. The amplitude and phase of the multipath factor are plotted as functions of the frequency over the audible range, for various relative positions of observer and source, and for several combinations of the reflection coefficients of the ground and wall. It is shown that the received signal consists of a double series of spectral bands, in other words: (i) the interference effects lead to spectral bands with peaks and zeros, (ii) the successive peaks also go through zeros and peaks of the peaks. The results apply not only to sound, but also to other waves, e.g., electromagnetic waves using the corresponding frequency band and reflection factors. 2020 Luiz Manuel Braga da Costa Campos et al.;2

We demonstrate an algorithm known as FastMDP-GPU that performs first-come-first-served pre-departure flight plan scheduling where conflict free flight plans are generated on demand. We demonstrate a par-allelized implementation of the algorithm on a Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) and show the level of performance and scaling that can be achieved. Our results show that on commodity GPU hardware we can perform flight plan scheduling against 2000-3000 known flight plans and with server-class hardware the performance can be higher.

N/A;2021;T.+Riley D.+Cuppoletti;Acoustic Analysis Framework For Prediction Of Uam Noise Radiation From Subscale Data;The noise generated by rotors for use on distributed electric propulsion aircraft for Urban Air Mobility must be considered from the early design stages. An acoustic analysis framework is developed to evaluate this noise from subscale data. Electrically driven rotors have strong tonal characteristics resulting from aerodynamic phenomena and motor noise, and adding a duct to the rotors is a possible noise reduction technique. An open and ducted rotor are operated with a linear array of microphones measuring the sound generated. This sound data is simulated with notional flight paths and evaluated using current noise metrics. It is evident that the flight path chosen for simulation has a significant impact on the noise exposure for ground observers. For both the open and ducted rotors, the Effective Perceived Noise Level and Sound Exposure Level are analyzed, though neither sufficiently account for the tonality of these rotors. Narrowband spectra show that the duct broadens the rotor tones and increases the broadband noise and the overall sound pressure level, for static conditions. However, the duct appears to significantly shield motor noise which is a point source as opposed to the distributed aerodynamic noise sources. These insights may help designers weigh the decision to use ducted rotors, as well as specifying flight paths for their vehicles. Regulatory bodies must be involved in the development of a new noise metric that is more appropriate for Urban Air Mobility vehicle noise sources. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2021;C.+Rame D.+Mavris;Development Of A Framework To Compare Low-Altitude Unmanned Air Traffic Management Systems;Several reports forecast a very high demand for Urban Air Mobility services such as package delivery and air taxi. This would lead to very dense low-altitude operations which cannot be safely accommodated by the current air traffic management system. Many different architectures for low-altitude air traffic management have been proposed in the literature, however, the lack of a common framework makes it difficult to compare strategies. The work presented here establishes efficiency, safety and capacity metrics, defines the components of an automated traffic management system architecture and introduces a preliminary framework to compare different alternatives. This common framework allows for the evaluation and comparison of different alternatives for unmanned traffic management. The framework is showcased on different strategies with different architectures. The impact of algorithmic choices and airspace architectures is evaluated. A decoupled approach to 4D trajectory planning is shown to scale poorly with agents density. The impact of segregating traffic by heading is shown to be very different depending on the algorithms and airspace access rules chosen. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

An understanding of the potential demand for UAM services is crucial for stakeholders to ensure that the supporting infrastructure is ready and does not hinder the introduction of these services. In a previous study, the authors developed a top-down methodology for evaluating the demand for global UAM networks by estimating the travelers willingness to pay for services and estimating the potential volume of UAM traffic. The methodology was implemented in that study for a subset of 31 cities distributed across the world in 2035. This paper seeks to expand the scope of the previous study to quantify global UAM demand for 542 of the top global cities in an extended time frame from 2035 up to 2050. Additionally, this study employs a scenario-based forecasting approach to capture long-term market demand based on low and high penetration levels for UAM services. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Due to the continuous increase in population, road traffic is increasing at alarming rates and the problem of congestion is also increasing in metro cities. These new services will provide improved ways for individuals to go around urban communities and urban territories while decreasing blockage. eVTOLs are aircraft that are capable of Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) with no requirement of run-up space and are tremendously getting popular when it comes to UAM due to the important factor of clean propulsion with zero-emission. The industry is rapidly proposing and adopting new vehicle concepts to meet consumer demands and hence conceptually designing these vehicles with basic guidelines will set a preliminary foundation for more innovative technologies to come. This research work sets a baseline procedure and an initial iteration example for the industries and upcoming companies in this sector hence focuses on the Conceptual designing of eVTOLs. The novelty of the presented work lies in enhanced eVTOL configuration using coaxial ducted tilt rotors with wings. 2020 IEEE.;2

Currently, available aviation design assurance methods using safety assurance standards are not suited for regulatory assurance of autonomous systems Aviation is facing enormous growth in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) technology. The challenge for applicants and regulators is to assure system safety of autonomous systems. The automobile industry, which is similarly challenged by autonomous systems, is finding some possible solutions. This paper explores whether the aviation industry can apply those solutions to UAS and UAM assurance. ANSI/UL 4600, Standard for Safety for the Evaluation of Autonomous Products, is the first and only publicly available autonomous safety standard. This standard is backed by a certified non-profit standards organization, Underwriters Laboratories. This standard has been recognized as an international American National Standards Institute (ANSI) approved standard. The goal-based, technology neutral features of ANSI/UL 4600 make it adaptable to other industries and applications. It assures safety through monitoring safety performance, which enables the desired aviation regulatory approach. It reflects stakeholder views from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who have contemplated the product liability for the design and manufacturing challenges associated with these new technologies. The applicability to the aviation industry can be understood in terms of these features:  Goal-Based and Technology Neutral: ANSI/UL 4600 does not require a specific design approach or specific technology. The applicant company must present an auditable and defensible evidence-based safety case. Those central features of safety and auditability follow the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliance philosophy and could be adapted to aviation.  Continued Airworthiness with Monitored Safety Metrics: The FAA's desire to move to performance-based standards with risk-based strategy is supported by ANSI/UL 4600. Further, ANSI/UL 4600 recognizes that continued safety is even more important than one-time initial approval/acceptance, especially for learning systems used in problem-solving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Functional transformations of learning systems are continuously monitored by OEMs. Continued airworthiness could be assessed using this method even though the system is presumably fielded with unknown risks due to new and novel technology.  Modernization of Regulatory Approaches: This methodology supports performance-based regulations with compliance required to enforce system-of-systems interoperability. Applicants could design and test appropriate to their technology while regulators can audit and check for safety case completeness. Over time, industry can standardize some portions of testing as the technology matures. Different standards and codified standard approaches could also be independently designed and adapted as technology becomes standardized across the industry. Aviation regulators are already on this path to make performance-based regulations where applicants have the choice of technology and standards that can support innovation.  Industry and Public Stakeholder Engagement: The standard has undergone industry and public scrutiny in the automobile segment with considered reviews from technical, legal, and actuarial perspectives. The FAA and The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) have been working to implement a safety case umbrella that encompasses all facets of UAS and UAM development, operation, and maintenance. The safety case umbrella is a systems approach to combine specific UAS and UAM nuances as they relate to current regulatory structure. While the approach affords a performance-based and risk-based oversight of aircraft design and development, production, maintenance and operation, the current regulations were not written to address AI and specifically machine learning. Even when those advanced techniques are not used, small UASs often use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technology and technology of unknown pedigree could also be assured by the regulators using that approach. The codified approach of ANSI/UL 4600 could be superimposed on the safety case umbrella approach based on current regulations. The exercise of creating an auditable safety case also increases applicant safety awareness and safety culture. For approval of UAS and UAM, this paper recommends a structured and practical framework with an evidence-based safety case, which also takes into consideration the current regulations for applicability to UAS and UAM safety. 2020 IEEE.;2

We reduce the complexity of the 3D planning problem to that of a 2D planning problem by leveraging regulatory restrictions and guidelines as well as mission-specific boundary conditions to simplify the configuration space. This is achieved through strict limitations and a projection of the search space into a quasi-2D plane. We further suggest a modular motion planning architecture of multiple planners, each of which is taylored to a specific flight phase and displays deterministic behaviour in memory and runtime complexity. Through the integration of regulatory considerations, we seek to provide a planning result that complies with future regulations for flights over congested areas beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) and allows feasible solutions for dense multi-vehicle operation of urban routes. In addition to the methodological approach, we introduce the application of image processing techniques to the generation of roadmaps from available maps. We apply the method to a mission scenario of realistic extend and show how it scales to obstacle-dense environments. The results indicate that efficient pre-processing of environment data can enable regulation-compliant path-planning for UAVs in urban environments on consumer hardware. 2020 IEEE.;2

Safe and reliable flight operations have to be ensured even for challenging conditions like fog, night or direct sunlight. In addition, robust, low-cost and low-maintenance infrastructure is required. Since using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not reliable in particular close to landing areas due to multi path errors or jamming, an GNSS denied navigation technique is required.This paper presents a radar based autonomous takeoff and landing system for VTOLs. The localization system requires only passive radar reflectors on the ground. A standard automotive radar, as used for driver assistance systems, is applied for detection. Fusion with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) further improves the localization accuracy. A dedicated landing platform is developed along with a flight guidance such that autonomous precision takeoff and landing can be conducted.Our system has been tested in extensive flight experiments. Indoor flight experiments proved the overall system performance even with bad visual conditions which we simulated with a fog machine. The system achieved a high localization accuracy with a mean absolute error below 0.1 m. All test flights resulted in a successful landing in the center of our landing platform. 2020 IEEE.;2

The UAM framework also includes other urban Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) services that will be supported by a mix of onboard, ground, piloted, and autonomous operations. Over the past few years UAM research has gained wide interest from companies and federal agencies as an on-demand innovative transportation option that can help reduce traffic congestion and pollution as well as increase mobility in metropolitan areas. The concepts of UAM/UAS operation in the National Airspace System (NAS) remains an active area of research to ensure safe and efficient operations. With new developments in smart vehicle design and infrastructure for air traffic management, there is a need for methods to integrate and test various components of the UAM framework. In this work, we report on the development of a virtual reality (VR) testbed using the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) technology for human-automation teaming and airspace operation research of UAM. Using a four-wall projection system with motion capture, the CAVE provides an immersive virtual environment with real-time full body tracking capability. We created a virtual environment consisting of San Francisco city and a vertical take-off-and-landing passenger aircraft that can fly between a downtown location and the San Francisco International Airport. The aircraft can be operated autonomously or manually by a single pilot who maneuvers the aircraft using a flight control joystick. The interior of the aircraft includes a virtual cockpit display with vehicle heading, location, and speed information. The system can record simulation events and flight data for post-processing. The system parameters are customizable for different flight scenarios, hence, the CAVE VR testbed provides a flexible method for development and evaluation of UAM framework. 2020 IEEE.;2

Despite it is first and foremost the urban population that would be affected by accessing lower airspace, only few studies addressed the public perception of using transport drones. Aiming to fill the gap of attitudinal and acceptance research in the context of drones, the article embraces the subject by presenting qualitative results of a series of five focus groups conducted in three German cities. The analysis of discussions shows that participants were largely ambivalent towards the use of drones, putting special emphasis on a variety of object-related factors (safety and security, sustainability, usefulness), subject-related factors (general perception of technology) and also context-related factors (potential societal implications of drone technology). Framed by a discussion of identified acceptance factors in the context of the present scientific debate and assessing drones' potential social implications the article provides a profound qualitative exploration into one of the most disruptive and controversial future technologies that may transform both the transport world and urban societies. 2020 Universidad de Valladolid.

The users dictate trip origin, destination and timing. One of the major components of this vision is urban air mobility (UAM) for the masses. UAM means a safe and efficient system for vehicles to move passengers and cargo within a city. In order to reach UAMs full market potential the vehicle will have to be autonomous. One of the primary challenges of autonomous flight is dealing with off-nominal events, both common and unforeseen, thus, intelligent contingency management (ICM) is one of the enabling technologies. In this context, the vehicle has to be aware of its internal state and external environment at all times, ascertain its capability and make decisions about mission completion or modification. All of these functions require data to model and assess the environment and then take actions based on these models. Necessarily, there is uncertainty associated with the data and the models generated from it. Since we are dealing with safety-critical systems, one of the main challenges of ICM is to generate sufficient data and to minimize its uncertainty to enable practical and safe decision making. We propose an overall architecture that incorporates deterministic and learning algorithm together to assess vehicle capabilities, project these into the future and make decision on mission management level. A layered approach allows for mature parts and technologies to be integrated into early highly automated vehicle before the final state of autonomy is reached. 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;2
N/A;2020;W.+Staruk L.+Butt G.+Hennig E.+Bonny C.+Gray D.+Represa R.+Toner;Wind Tunnel Testing And Analysis Of A Rigid, Variable Speed Rotor For Evtol Applications;Many electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft intended for the urban air mobility (UAM) market are currently being designed with multirotor configurations using variable speed fixed-pitch, rigid rotors for lift. These types of rotors, which are similar in construction to general aviation airplane propellers, are simpler than helicopter rotors and have no moving parts in the rotating frame. This paper discusses wind-tunnel testing of a full-scale, UAM multirotor size, fixed-pitch, rigid rotor with a focus on vibratory blade loads and on the ability to predict these loads with comprehensive analysis. Test results show that vibratory loads are very high, with peak-to-peak magnitudes up to three times greater than the steady component. Correlation of test data to comprehensive analysis using geometrically exact composite beam structural elements and dynamic inflow wake modeling captures the trends in the steady and vibratory loads, but under-predicts the magnitudes by up to 50%. The paper also discusses the physical sources of the observed vibratory loads and suggests potential options for mitigating their magnitude. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;2
N/A;2020;D.+Jayasundara Y.+S.+Jung J.+Baeder;Cfd And Aeroacoustic Analysis Of Wingtip-Mounted Propellers;The wingtip-mounted propeller configuration is widely used in many aircraft, especially with the emergence of urban air mobility. This study focuses on analyzing the aeroacoustic properties of this configuration by understanding the aerodynamic interaction between the propeller and wing. Computational Fluid Dynamics based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations was used to calculate the flow field and the aerodynamic loads on a wingtip-mounted propeller model and were compared with experimental data for validation. The resulting surface pressure was fed as input data for the acoustic analysis performed using a Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings equation-based acoustic solver at multiple angles of attack. It was observed that the presence of the wing significantly increases the propeller noise along the rotational axis. As the angle of attack increases, the propeller noise increases further. However, the wing noise decreases with the angle of attack due to propeller wake dissipation, leading to only a small increase in the maximum total noise. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;2

The model attempts to characterize the lift degradation of a section of the rotor, effectively converting the 3D rotor environment to a 2D problem. The 2D ice accretion was reached by removing all the ice from the blade but a strip of ice at a selected spanwise location. The model was developed using a 14-inch carbon fiber 2 bladed rotor. Accreted ice to the rotor was removed except at 75% of the rotor, spanning +/-1 inch. Baseline lift coefficients were determined empirically using experimental thrust value measured and baseline drag coefficients were acquired from NACA 0015 lookup tables. From 36 experimental cases, the model over-predicted rotor thrust by an average of 33%. Using the Han-Palacios Correlation for the iced drag coefficients, the model under-predicted rotor torque by an average of 37%. These errors were attributed to 3D effects due to the sectional ice left on the rotor being too large for the inherent 2D assumptions used. Smaller ice strips should be used to develop the empirical model and reduce uncertainty. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;2
10.2514/6.2020-0656;2020;J.+Chen;Fast Planning For Joint Routing And Charging Of Autonomous Drone Delivery System;Recent developments and investigations in autonomous electric aerial vehicles (EAVs) are expected to bring the aviation into a new era. Thanks to their unmanned and autonomous nature, EAVs are widely used or proposed for various aviation applications in the low altitude airspace, such as drone delivery and urban air mobility. To take the limited battery endurance into the route planning loop, this paper proposes a joint optimization methodology to handle the optimal routing and charging tasks at the same time. The joint optimization problem can effectively save system operational cost by considering the unique characteristics of EAVs. The joint problem is firstly formulated as a mixed integer linear program, which is NP-hard. To improve computing efficiency, we further develop a distributed heuristic algorithm. The problem formulation and the heuristic algorithm are both well validated through comprehensive simulations. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This work further explores the eVTOL design space, by presenting an analysis of a six-passenger eVTOL quadrotor powertrain, with integrated power, propulsion, and thermal management systems modeled using the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) and the NPSS Power System Library. Four powertrain architectures are modeled at the same design point and compared over a design mission. Results from an architecture trade study show that a hybrid architecture performs best in terms of range, however, the hybrid needs batteries with high specific energy and specific power in order to obtain a benefit over turboelectric architectures. Parameteric sensitivity studies are conducted to determine correlations between component parameters and system metrics. This data provides useful indicators for further technological improvement. Lastly an initial TMS model is presented, and sensitivity studies on TMS design parameters are presented as well, to show high level TMS design trends. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

It will exploit the third dimension to help smooth ground traffic in densely populated areas. To be successful, it will require an organized and integrated approach able to balance efficiency and safety while harnessing common airspace resources. We believe that mathematical optimization will play an essential role to support the development of Urban Air Mobility. In this paper, we describe two important problems from this domain, operators 4D volume deconfliction, and air taxi trajectory deconfliction. Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.;2

In order to do so, the UTM project has developed an architecture to allow communication among UAS operators, UAS Service Suppliers (USS), Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP), and the public. As part of this framework, the Supplemental Data Service Providers (SDSP) are envisioned as model and/or data based services that disseminate essential or enhanced information to ensure safe operations within low-altitude airspace. These services include terrain and obstacle data, specialized weather data, surveillance, constraint information, risk monitoring, etc. This paper highlights the development efforts of a non-participant casualty risk assessment SDSP called Ground Risk Assessment Service Provider (GRASP) which assists operators with pre-flight planning. GRASP is based on the previously introduced UTM Risk Assessment Framework (URAF) and allows UAS operators to simulate and visualize potential non-participant casualty risks associated with their proposed flight. The risk assessment capability also allows operators to revise their flight plans if the casualty risks are determined to be above acceptable thresholds. GRASP is configured to account for future improvements including servicing airborne aircraft as part of NASA's System-Wide Safety (SWS) project. 2019 IEEE.;2

This implies important safety and efficiency needs, and big deployment challenges. We will focus in this article on malicious threats in this sensitive environment. For example, an attacker might compromise the onboard systems of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), with catastrophic consequences for passengers and people on the ground. It is hence important to design, implement, deploy, maintain and operate appropriate security mechanisms, to detect threats and mitigate or recover from compromises (e.g. safe emergency landing). This contributes to the high safety and performance requirements for passengers, public and infrastructure. Research around the security challenges for these air mobility operations is a recent topic, and many challenges are still to be resolved. We aim to contribute with a survey of possible attacks, an adversary model, and potential security solutions, along with a preliminary study for vehicle recovery. 2019 IEEE.;2

For example, in this increasingly diverse future air traffic operations, the interaction and integration of on-demand operations with traditional, largely scheduled operations will lead them to share existing commercial airspace with increased requirements on data exchange and control schemes to ensure adequate safety margins. In this new paradigm, the traditional operations will need to transform from current vector-based operation to a more integrated trajectory-based operation (TBO) in which the aircraft's trajectory intents are more strategically planned, precisely tracked, and collaboratively coordinated. Over the years, NASA has been developing, demonstrating and transferring air traffic management concepts to the FAA to support surface, departure and arrival metering, as well as dynamic reroutes for weather avoidance. This paper describes a framework for combining and advancing those NASA efforts to improve arrival and departure demand management by integrating select NASA TBO capabilities with the Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS), Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM), and the Terminal Flight Data Manager (TFDM) tools to enable TBO across the NAS. The overall concept incorporates operator priorities and preferences in a service-oriented approach to managing complex, high demand airports. 2019 IEEE.;2

Many of these challenges are researched today, and solutions are investigated. The main goal of this ongoing research is to develop a safe and sustainable UAM system looking at the design of vehicles and airspace. However, despite research and testing, it is conceivable that when the UAM vehicles actually become operational, accidents will occur. Here in lies the problem, are accident investigators ready for UAM vehicle accidents? Historically, aviation accident investigations had been reactive and investigation outcomes provided recommendations, which paved the way for incremental safety improvements. Rules and procedures are in place to provide a feedback loop to lower the accident rate and maintain a safe aviation environment in its current form. To establish a UAM safety level, the installation and implementation of technical aids and procedures to assist investigators in future UAM accidents are required. These requirements need to be addressed before implementing a new UAM system in order to provide the required feedback loop to maintain an acceptable level of safety. This paper will address the challenges that future accident investigators will face in a UAM vehicle accident investigation. This paper provides feedback from accident investigation professionals who participated in a prognostic survey to discuss what technical means are required to investigate UAM vehicle accidents. It will provide recommendations to future UAM systems designers to address and enable accident investigation in order to maintain and enhance the future UAM safety level. The final goal of this paper is to discover potential UAM accident scenarios which may not be immediately apparent to engineers during conceptual design and identify potential design requirements in terms of investigation capability. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-3000;2019;S.+Salinger L.+Rajauski J.+A.+Cole;Conceptual Design Of Electric Helicopters For Urban Air Mobility;There is currently interest in the design of small electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft to alleviate ground traffic and congestion in major urban areas. To support progress in this area, a conceptual design method for single-main-rotor and lift-augmented compound electric helicopters has been developed. To validate the method, flight test results from two existing experimental electric helicopters were used to create notional mission profiles that were applied in the design of new aircraft. The weight, power, and energy results of the designed aircraft were found to be reasonably similar to the test aircraft in both cases. The design method was then used to investigate the feasible design space for electric helicopters based on varying mission profiles and technology assumptions. The results for each configuration show that the design space is sensitive to battery energy density and that mission length variables such as hover time and cruise distance are more impactful than other mission profile parameters on the resulting vehicle design. Within the feasible design space, it was found that a crossover boundary exists as a function of cruise distance and hover time where the most efficient configuration changes from a single-main-rotor helicopter to a lift-augmented compound helicopter. In general, for longer cruise distances and shorter hover times, the lift-augmented compound helicopter is the more efficient configuration. For longer hover times and shorter cruise distances, the single-main-rotor helicopter is the more efficient configuration. The results provide selection criteria based on desired mission profile for comparing electric single-main-rotor helicopters and electric lift-augmented compound helicopters for urban air mobility purposes. 2019 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

10.2514/6.2019-3629;2019;T.+Edwards S.+Verma J.+Keeler;Exploring Human Factors Issues For Urban Air Mobility Operations;Urban air mobility (UAM) is receiving increased attention in aviation as a system for passenger and cargo-carrying new entrants in urban airspace. In order to develop a safe and efficient system, numerous possible concepts of operation for UAM are being explored throughout industry and research domains, the features and assumptions of which may differ according to near, medium and far term operations. Much of the current research into the development of UAM has dominantly focused on technological and engineering capabilities, such as vehicle development. Although these areas of research are essential to furthering UAM, research into the role of the human operator in UAM is limited. The research described in this paper aims to begin to address this gap by investigating the capabilities and implications of human operators as traffic managers in the UAM system, focusing on near-term UAM operations. A human in the loop air traffic control simulation was used to investigate the effect of UAM traffic density, airspace routes and communication procedures on subjective workload and efficiency-related task performance. Findings indicate that medium and high-density operations were associated with high workload. A reduction in verbal communications through a letter of agreement, and optimized routes, were associated with reduced workload and increased performance efficiency. However, even with these adjustments, reported workload remained high, particularly during the high-density scenario. Future research should focus on the human operator roles and responsibilities, and the amount of involvement, in UAM system management. Particular focus should be directed on the impact of reduced human operator involvement and increased automation, on the safety and efficiency of UAM operations and the integration of UAM with traditional air traffic management. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-3256;2019;B.+Lascara A.+Lacher M.+Degarmo L.+Vempati R.+Zimmerman;Behavioral Competency Model For Safety Assurance Of Automated Aviation Systems;The aviation industry is increasingly taking advantage of flight-deck automation systems, rather than human pilots, to perform complex flight functions that enable new flight applications. Some future operators envision a world in which many or all flight functions are performed by automated aircraft systems to enable high tempo air cargo delivery and passenger transportation services, often referred to as Urban Air Mobility. Others envision flight operations with some limited human role but not requiring the sophisticated skills of todays pilots. These aircraft systems will be responsible for performing highly complex tasks and may redefine the roles and responsibilities for human decision-makers. Given the complexity of these future systems, operators and regulators will be challenged in using existing software certification mechanisms for making a safety assurance case for an operation. Updates to existing software development and certification techniques, such as DO178C will help in achieving safety assurance. This paper presents an additional safety assurance approach which may be applicable for a wide variety of highly automated aviation applications. Referred to as the Behavioral Competency Model, this approach begins by identifying all functions associated with a flight operation. Once functions are identified, key aspects associated with safety assurance, such as human/machine roles, safety hazards, and automation complexity/maturity are evaluated to help determine an appropriate validation rigor that is needed to assure the safe execution of the function. The approach is presented, followed by an appendix which exercises the approach using a specific aircraft application. The model can be used as a tool to assess and communicate the functional performance of automation systems. Operators and regulators could use this tool as a standardized mechanism to help assure safety of a new entrant operation during the operational approval process. 2019 The MITRE Corporation.

N/A;2019;U.+Saetti J.+Enciu J.+F.+Horn;Performance And Design Optimization Of The F-Helix Evtol Concept;The objective of the paper is to study the F-Helix eVTOL concept. This concept modifies the SH-4 Silvercraft light helicopter to use electric propulsion and a tip driven rotor. It is intended to compete with rotorcraft in the light-weight class and address future urban air mobility needs. The elimination of shaft driven propulsion is intended to reduce weight and drag in order to accommodate the added weight of batteries for energy storage. Once the configuration of the rotorcraft is established, the design is optimized to produce the least power required while still meeting the structural and physical constraints of its components. Next, a simulation model is developed to assess the rotorcraft performance in hover and forward flight. The payload/range performance is then evaluated for a typical aerial urban transportation mission. Finally, the performance of the eVTOL configuration is compared to the SH-4. 2019 Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;2
N/A;2019;E.+Cacciavillani F.+Ielmini;Numerical Study And Optimization Of A Novel Architecture Of Vertiport And Vertistop For Urban Air Mobility;Currently the VTOL world sees a high number of players investing in electrification, especially coming from the lower end of the market: like commercial drones and startups. Electric engines allow for new architectures and configurations, and partially simplify the design. Simplifying design, lowering cost of development and maintenance, has led to imagine the use of the eVTOL in the passengers air transportation market, currently reserved to VIP and high net worth individuals. The shift is potentially so radical that a new name has been coined: Urban Air Mobility. This new market is widely imagined as a radical change compared to the current situation: with more traffic, simplified procedures for boarding and in some cases the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles. This leads to the conclusion that the whole transportation system architecture will have to be upgraded or modified to allow for this to happen. Many projects are already running in this direction regarding specific topics, like SESAR JU [1] for Air Traffic Management. This paper treats the Ground Infrastructure, what is commonly referred as Heliport. In the paper a novel architecture envisioned for Urban Air Mobility is proposed and analyzed.

The current archetypical path encompasses moving from informational displays, where the human directly controls the machine based on information displayed, to automation where the human still directs the machine that then caries out the request using predefined set of instructions. Rapid pace of technological advancement makes it possible now, or in a near future, for machines to reach a level of intelligence that enables for systems to execute tasks/missions without predefined specific instructions, thus attaining a status of non-human autonomous agents. Now the course of human-machine interface technology changes from an information system to automation to an autonomous agentessentially moving from a master-servant relationship to teammates. This paper discusses these changing relationships and challenges associated with progressing from a master-servant relationship with technology to more of an equal teammate. Examples of this progression includes current work encompassing rotorcraft noise minimization for urban air mobility. 2019;2

It is designed to be operated in a dynamic multi-user environment where the individual sensor's RF bandwidth is very limited. Here, the radar uses only 30 MHz. The targeted applications are in the field of Urban (Air) Mobility (UAM) with a medium-range coverage up to 250 m. Another requirement is to observe a wide field of view in azimuth of about 100 degree with a high resolution in azimuth. This was implemented by using a 2  8 MIMO processing. A 20 ms frame based evaluation of the OFDM symbols allows to obtain a very high velocity resolution of below 1 m/s. This paper explains details about the radar system, the waveform and the processing but the main part of the paper focuses on the evaluation of a dynamic measurement. 2018 IEEE.;2
10.2514/6.2018-3356;2018;N.+K.+Borer;Catalyzing Disruptive Mobility Opportunities Through Transformational Aviation Power;Lightweight, efficient power production has been a pacing technology for aviation. Advances in airborne electric propulsion technology have enabled new aviation concepts in markets that previously were not dominated by aviation systems, largely because electric propulsion allows for efficient, integrated propulsion/aerodynamic/control solutions that were previously not practical with combustion-based power architectures. These new markets include automated package delivery, urban air mobility, and short-haul transportation. As these markets evolve, the impact of using electricity for airborne propulsion on an expanding mission set, as well as the sheer amount of energy consumed, will begin to challenge the energy harvesting and distribution paradigm as it exists today. Left unaddressed, these challenges could stymie the evolution of these new markets and mobility options. This paper identifies some of the potential systemic issues associated with the expanded use of electric propulsion and explores the requirements associated with alternate aviation power architectures. The recommended path includes the development of a new hybrid-electric aviation power architecture that can be used in conjunction with a portfolio of evolving battery-electric and combustion-based systems. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Air EMS can move patients or live organs more rapidly than surface modes over long distances or congested areas. Air EMS also provides unparalleled access to accident scenes in regions where surface transportation is compromised such as in the backcountry or during disaster scenarios. However, despite these unique capabilities, Air EMS is currently provided to only a small minority of the most critical medical cases. This is due to the high historical cost and risk of airborne operations. Air EMS costs are driven primarily by the high level of availability required of these services and their low utilization. The elevated accident rate compared to other forms of aviation is in large part due to the operation of these services to and from off-field landing areas with unmarked and perhaps unknown obstacles. This research investigates opportunities to increase the number of Air EMS operations provided in a region by reducing the cost per operation and increasing the level of care. Significant recent investments in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are maturing a new class of electric aircraft and automation technologies that may provide benefits to Air EMS operations. Furthermore, opportunities to deploy Air EMS assets as part of a UAM system to increase utilization and reduce costs through revenue management are also reviewed. Finally, potential pathways to leverage Air EMS as a proving ground and forcing function to overcome constraints in air traffic control and community acceptance for broader UAM services are discussed. The results of this study suggest that near-term electric aircraft are not expected to meet the requirements of the Air EMS mission and also provide little cost reduction potential for the industry. However, new operational models that leverage UAM markets and airline revenue management systems show promise to enhance Air EMS scale. Finally, flight automation technologies in development for UAM aircraft show potential to increase Air EMS safety. 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This paper presents an air traffic assignment framework for 3D air transport networks in urban airspace to enable UAM operations at future demand levels. The individual vehicle dynamics are aggregated to describe the overall flow feature in this macroscopic model. Firstly, UAM operations are modeled as flows and structured in a three-dimensional two-way air transport network. Then, a complexity optimal air traffic assignment in urban airspace is formulated as an optimization problem. Based upon the Linear Dynamical System (LDS), a novel complexity metric is defined as objective function, which takes into account dynamic flow structure, congestion, and operational efficiency. A two-phase approach combining Simulated Annealing (SA) and Dafermos Algorithm (DA) is introduced to efficiently solve this problem. To validate the proposed model, a case study of an air transport network in Singapore's urban airspace with two different demands is conducted. Comparative studies are carried out between the proposed algorithm and other widely used traffic assignment algorithms. The results show that the proposed approach is capable of assigning flows in an efficient and effective manner, reducing the complexity of the air transport network significantly.

10.1016/j.ast.2022.107631;2022;S.+Wang X.+Zhan Y.+Zhai L.+Zheng B.+Liu;Enhancing Navigation Integrity For Urban Air Mobility With Redundant Inertial Sensors;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) uses highly automated air vehicles to offer safe and efficient low-altitude urban air transportation services, for which ensuring navigation safety (measured by integrity) is an essential precondition. UAM vehicles can navigate themselves using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) tightly coupled systems. However, these systems are vulnerable to IMU failures aside from GNSS faults, given that UAM vehicles will use low-cost IMUs. IMU faults can severely degrade navigation integrity, thereby threatening UAM operational safety and increasing the difficulty of urban air traffic management. This issue can be mitigated by employing redundant IMUs. Civil aircraft use consistency checks among multiple high-performance Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) to enhance navigation integrity. But this approach is not suitable for low-cost IMUs because of fast error accumulation. In response, this work proposes a new approach to enhance navigation integrity for UAM by integrating multiple IMUs with GNSS. In this approach, multiple IMUs and GNSS are tightly coupled by a centralized Kalman filter, and the corresponding integrity monitoring algorithm is developed to (a) detect the faults in GNSS and/or IMUs and (b) evaluate the probabilistic upper bounds on navigation errors, namely protection levels. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method and to present sensitivity analyses, and the results suggest the effectiveness of the new approach. This method is beneficial to improving UAM operational safety and can potentially be applied to civil aircraft in the future. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;1
10.3390/buildings12060747;2022;A.+Takacs T.+Haidegger;Infrastructural Requirements And Regulatory Challenges Of A Sustainable Urban Air Mobility Ecosystem;The United Nations has long put on the discussion agenda the sustainability challenges of urbanization, which have both direct and indirect effects on future regulation strategies. Undoubtedly, most initiatives target better quality of life, improved access to services & goods and environment protection. As commercial aerial urban transportation may become a feasible research goal in the near future, the connection possibilities between cities and regions scale up. It is expected that the growing number of vertical takeoff & landing vehicles used for passenger and goods transportation will change the infrastructure of the cities, and will have a significant effect on the cityscapes as well. In addition to the widely discussed regulatory and safety issues, the introduction of elevated traffic also raises environmental concerns, which influences the existing and required service and control infrastructure, and thus significantly affects sustainability. This paper provides narrated overview of the most common aspects of safety, licensing and regulations for passenger vertical takeoff & landing vehicles, and highlights the most important aspects of infrastructure planning, design and operation, which should be taken into account to maintain and efficiently operate this new way of transportation, leading to a sustainable urban air mobility ecosystem. 2022 by the authors.

Their environmental noise impact should not be ignored and should be a certification consideration. Numerical simulations can provide means to efficiently assess the noise impact on the complex urban environments, thanks to the advances in both software and hardware. In this study, virtual flights of the noise sources to mimic the drones and urban air mobilities are conducted to investigate the environmental impact by using the Gaussian beam tracing method implemented in an in-house solver Environmental Acoustic Ray Tracing Code, in which the dominant acoustic processes in outdoor applications are modelled. The solver also allows for modelling of sources with generic directivity patterns, which is beneficial for investigating the drone and urban air mobility noise produced by multiple rotors. Two examples of studying noise impact on building and realistic urban environment are conducted. The effects of the surface acoustic impedance, source type and flight path are investigated. By using the efficient simulation solver, the noise impact can be quickly assessed through virtual flights, providing a promising approach to assist the low-noise flight planning and noise certification. 2022;1

For this purpose, a framework, combining aircraft design methods with an agent-based simulation, is developed. Thereby, not only different UAM aircraft architectures, but also fleet combinations, technology scenarios, and operational strategies are studied and evaluated for different success criteria. The UAM fleets are simulated for 24-hour operations, considering non-uniform passenger demand, dispatch of passenger as well as deadhead flights, aircraft architectural performance, load factor, energy consumption, and turnaround procedures. A large design of experiments, consisting of approximately 5,000 design points, is executed. Eventually, this article demonstrates the proof of concept for the proposed SoS framework and provides several parameter sensitivities for a given UAM scenario. For such complex SoS, analytical methods would not suffice for understanding complex and often nonlinear interactions. Therefore, the proposed simulation driven framework proves to be successful by providing sensitivity study results, linking subsystem, system (aircraft) and system of system (fleet) level. Thus, the framework allows for comprehensive understanding of the SoS design space and is important for successful deployment or optimization of UAM aircraft & fleet for a given city and operational context. 2021 The Authors;1
10.3390/electronics11081225;2022;J.+Jover A.+Berm R.+Casado;Priority-Aware Conflict Resolution For U-Space;In the context of the future urban mobility airspaces, U-space lays the foundation for unmanned aircrafts to be integrated with conventionally manned traffic to offer a multitude of services to citizens and businesses, such as urban public transport, goods movement, parcel delivery, etc. Given these extensive possibilities, it is estimated that thousands of aircrafts (or even more) from different owners will share common airspace volumes, and the probability that all of them will travel without colliding is extremely low if no means are put in place to prevent it. This paper aims to introduce the reader to the conflict management policy proposed in U-space and proposes a new version of the PCAN (Prediction-based Conflict-free Adaptive Navigation) algorithm to adapt to this policy. In particular, the new implementation of PCAN takes into account a more than likely classification of flights according to their priority. The evaluation of this priority-aware algorithm shows that it is still possible to avoid any conflict between the set of aircraft in flight, with an insignificant detriment to higher priority flights, while maintaining minimal detriment on average. 2022 by the authors.

This work focuses on the development and application of a generic methodology for the design, performance, and environmental impact assessment of a parallel hybrid-electric propulsion system, utilizing simple and advanced recuperated engine cycles. A simulation framework for rotorcraft analysis comprising models for rotor aerodynamics, flight dynamics, and hybrid-electric powerplant performance is deployed for the design exploration and optimization of a hybrid-electric rotorcraft, modeled after the NASA XV-15, adapted for civil applications. Optimally designed powerplants for payload-range capacity, energy efficiency, and environmental impact have been obtained. A comparative evaluation has been performed for the optimum designs. The respective tradeoffs between engine, heat exchanger weight, thermal efficiency, as well as mission fuel burn and environmental impact have been quantified. It has been demonstrated that a recuperated gas turbine-based hybrid-electric architecture may provide improvements of up to 6% in mission range capability without sacrificing useful load. At the same time, analyses performed for a representative 100 km mission suggest reductions in fuel burn and NOX emissions of up to 12.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Analyses are carried at aircraft and mission level using realistic UAM mission scenarios. Copyright 2022 by Rolls-Royce plc.;1
10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843796;2022;M.+Corbetta K.+Jarvis P.+Banerjee;Uncertainty Propagation In Pre-Flight Prediction Of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Separation Violations;Current forecasts on the future of aeronautics suggest an increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles entering the low-altitude airspace in the next decades. Small vehicles for package delivery as well as larger vehicles for urban air mobility will change the dynamics of the airspace, increasing density of operations both in time, i.e. high number of take-off and landings per unit time, and in space, operating in dense urban environment. This scenario poses challenges to the current approach to air traffic control, and large efforts from academia, industry and regulatory bodies are dedicated to the development of new traffic management strategies that leverage higher computing and simulating capabilities avail-able today. In this paper, we propose a simple look-ahead approach to predict potential minimum separation violations at the strategic level, that is before vehicles start flying, depending on the predefined 4D trajectories and uncertainty affecting the wind acting along those routes. Wind forecast data are provided by True Weather Solutions, Inc. on a sparse grid of latitude/longitude coordinates. We then interpolate the sparse data using Gaussian process regression to obtain an estimate of wind speed and direction, while uncertainty affecting the expected ground speed is propagated through error intervals. The approach allows the prediction of aircraft separation as a function of time, highlighting potential safety violations that would go undetected if uncertainty affecting the expected 4D trajectories was not considered. The paper will also discuss issues related to accuracy and scalability of the approach to multiple vehicle operations. 2022 IEEE.;1
10.2514/6.2022-3403;2022;L.+Spirkovska C.+S.+Kulkarni J.+Watkins L.+Martin;Urban Air Mobility Airspace Dynamic Density;Effective flight planning requires information about a variety of potential threats, such as adverse weather or airspace restrictions, and about alternatives available if unforeseen events occur. Expected traffic along the route of flight is also essential to a safe outcome so that, for example, adequate fuel/energy supply can be loaded prior to flight. A dynamic density (DD) metric is introduced for the emerging urban air mobility (UAM) concept to predict airspace congestion that may lead to loss of separation between aircraft or less efficient operations. Using inspiration from dynamic density metric research for traditional air traffic management and a two-way highway analogy, we develop a dynamic density metric for a portion of airspace (a UAM corridor) that aggregates the impact from five factors: aircraft density, density of populous clusters, mean number of aircraft in populous clusters, mean distance between aircraft, and minimum distance between aircraft. This works describes our methodology, rationale, use cases, and visualization techniques to efficiently present the DD metric to an operator for informed decision making. We also present an approach for validating the metric. However, validation remains part of future work. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;1

A major part of the solution towards achieving the UAM/AAM vision will be assured and trusted autonomy that enable human operators and passengers to interact with autonomous systems that transport humans and cargo with high assurance of safety, security and reliability. Given the complex interactions among the autonomy algorithms, human, environment and UAM control, there is a need for vehicle-level monitoring that detects emerging hazard scenarios. The data gathered from UAM systems that would help detect emerging hazards will be diverse: from highly-regular information (onboard flight controls) to irregular streaming information (weather, real time population dynamics). This paper presents a systematic approach for developing model-and data-driven hazard monitoring framework which we call pervasive monitoring. The aim of pervasive monitoring is to comprehensively observe a Cyber Physical System (CPS) at different architectural levels to ensure its safety and security with respect to its intended operation. Since there is no single monitor type that solves complex in-time hazard detection problems for UAM, we assert that several classes of monitors are needed to address this challenge. In this paper, we present a methodology based on STPA that partitions the UAM hazard monitoring challenge into two problems: a context monitoring problem and vehicle monitoring problem. We present preliminary results on deriving monitors from STPA, and realization of the monitors using the NASA Runtime Verification language Copilot. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3318;2022;H.+Tang Y.+Zhang J.+Post;Pre-Departure Flight Planning To Minimize Operating Cost For Urban Air Mobility;Urban air mobility (UAM) is envisioned to move to highly automated and high-density operations in low altitude urban airspace in the future. Providers of services for UAM (PSU), rather than the legacy Air Traffic Control, are anticipated to support operators with operational planning, aircraft deconfliction, conformance monitoring, and emergency information dissemination. Such services, for hundreds to thousands of simultaneous UAM operations in constrained airspace, can only be realized with automated systems. In this study, we propose methods for generating pre-departure conflict-free four-dimensional (4D) flight trajectories, which can be further developed into an automated flight planning tool for PSU. We propose a semi-structured airspace design for future UAM, i.e., a layered airspace topology with direct routes between vertiports, avoiding physical obstacles such as buildings, obstructions, and restricted airspace using the visibility graph method. Based on the proposed airspace design, deconfliction strategies, e.g., flight level assignment and departure delay, are applied to obtain pre-departure conflict-free 4D trajectories of UAM operations by solving a mixed-integer programming model, with the objective function minimizing the operating cost of UAM operations. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the impacts of three key cost parameters (electricity price, crew hourly rate, and maintenance hourly rate). The relationships of departure delay bound (maximum departure delay allowed) vs. operating cost saving and departure delay bound vs. delay cost to passengers are examined, as is the tradeoff between operating cost saving and passenger delay cost. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Concepts range from multi-copters to tilt-rotors to other 'flying car' vehicles. While these concepts offer an exciting look into what the future might bring, can the Urban Air Mobility mission be accomplished today using existing certified aircraft? This paper provides flight test results for a Robinson R44, a Cessna 172, and a Pipistrel Velis Electro flying the same Urban Air Mobility mission trajectory. The baseline trajectory has an aircraft flying 10 nautical miles from Point A to Point B at an altitude of 2,000 feet above ground level. This trajectory accomplishes the mission of many Urban Air Mobility scenarios, where customers transit from regional airports to city centers. In addition to time-space position information, gallons of aviation gas consumed, noise data, and vehicle costs are provided. These data can be used for analyses of alternatives for urban planners and other researchers considering concepts for Urban Air Mobility. 2022 IEEE.;1
10.2514/6.2022-3911;2022;S.+Paul S.+Chowdhury;A Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Framework For Urban Air Mobility Fleet Scheduling;Optimal scheduling of the fleet of aircraft comprising an urban air mobility (UAM) network is key to economically viable and sustainable integration of UAM networks within our existing urban and suburban transportation ecosystems. To this end, this paper firstly formulates the UAM fleet scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) over a graph space, with the graph representing the network of vertiports (and their dynamic properties, e.g., demand) being served by these aircraft. A simulation environment that incorporates real-world constraints associated with aircraft characteristics (e.g., max speed and battery capacity), passenger transport demand and electricity pricing is developed and used to evaluate schedules modeled by this MDP. The event-triggered action of each aircraft is determined in a decentralized manner using a novel policy model embodied by a neural network comprising a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based encoder and a Multi-head attention (MHA) based decoder. A policy gradient based reinforcement learning (RL) method is used to train this model. Motivated by the emerging work in learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems, this GNN-based policy model is expected to capture the local and global structural information of the UAM network, allowing the trained policies to generalize across demand and aircraft initialization scenarios. Compared to a simple feasible randomized baseline and a typical multi-layer neural network based policy, our method demonstrates a remarkable 25% better performance in terms of the estimated average daily profit. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

NASA projects that UAM is capable of wide-spread operations in its matured states of service. The advances in modeling capabilities will allow the evaluation of wider sets of operational scenarios and conditions for future operations. The efforts to evaluate gaps in UAM operations modeling is significant because of the greater role the models have for aircraft design and fleet allocation research.

10.2514/6.2022-3912;2022;S.+Deniz Y.+Wu Y.+Shi Z.+Wang;A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach To Traffic Control At Merging Point Of Urban Air Mobility;Traffic management at merging points is one of the most challenging problems in both ground and air transportation systems. While most common solutions for merging control of ground transportation is First In First Out, air transportation vehicles are usually coordinated by an air traffic controller (ATC). ATC communicates with pilots via radio to direct the aircraft and resolve the conflict during the flight. Highly increasing demand in drone delivery and air mobility will increase air density, particularly in urban areas, which requires highly automated ATC systems. To meet the increasing demand in air transportation, a high standard autonomous support system is needed. With that growing demand and to keep airspace safe and efficient, we need an autonomous air traffic controller. In this study, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to handle high-density urban air mobility (UAM) operations by providing effective guidance to electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles to avoid conflicts, mitigate traffic congestion, and reduce travel time at merging points. The goal of our MARL approach is to reduce the time while ensuring safe separation at the environed urban air merging points by providing the speed advisories for each eVTOL vehicle to merge into the same air corridor. The proposed model is trained and evaluated using BlueSky, an open-source ATC simulation environment. Simulation results of thousands of aircraft using real-world data show that MARL is very promising to enable safe and efficient UAM operations at merging points. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA., All rights reserved.;1

As such, it is necessary to be able to predict the noise produced by these vehicles at the earliest stages of the design process. Propeller design is an important aspect in which vehicle noise can be reduced. In this work a BEMT based propeller simulation and optimisation framework is presented, capable of predicting the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance and optimising the blade geometry subject to acoustic constraints. As part of this tool aerofoil aerodynamics are obtained using a machine learning approach, allowing for optimisation of the blade profile as well as an increase in computational efficiency. The application of this tool to a baseline experimental propeller is included, increasing the aerodynamic efficiency by over 10%. Including the aerofoil shape in this optimisation process allowed for a maximum additional efficiency increase of 2%. The effect of noise constraints are also studied and were found to reduce the optimal efficiency. The inclusion of aerofoil shape in the optimisation was found to mitigate the deterioration of optimal efficiency as more stringent noise constraints are imposed. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA., All rights reserved.;1
N/A;2022;S.+Li S.+Lee;Analytic Prediction Of Rotor Broadband Noise With Serrated Trailing Edges;Trailing-edge serrations are known to be an effective way to reduce broadband noise on wing sections, but their noise reduction capabilities on rotorcraft have not been fully understood. This paper develops a new approach to analytically predicting and investigating broadband noise of rotors with serrated trailing edges. To achieve rotorcraft broadband noise predictions, we extend Lyu and Ayton's semi-infinite serrated wing model to include the finite blade span, the modified scattering coefficient, and the spanwise observer distance. The validations show good agreements with experimental data for serrated trailing-edge noise of a wing section, a hovering rotor, and a forward-flight rotor. Next, the effects of serration parameters on rotor broadband noise are studied. For optimal and realistic rotor broadband noise reduction, the desirable design of a serrated-blade rotor has the serration height to wavelength ratio of 2, the radial range of serrations from 50% blade span to the tip. It is also found that the sine-wave, chopped peak, or saw-tooth serration shapes reduce noise most among various shapes that are considered. Finally, noise reduction with serrations is applied to urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft. A 6-passenger eVTOL quadrotor is found to have more than 9 dB noise reduction potential with serrated trailing edges, where higher noise reductions are observed with higher tip speeds and fewer blades. Serrated-blade quadrotors are found to have the dipole broadband noise directivity, and noise reductions are observed at all observer angles. Copyright 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society.

N/A;2022;D.+G.+Caprace A.+Ning;Large Eddy Simulation Of The Wakes Of Three Urban Air Mobility Vehicles;Recent advances in urban air mobility have driven the development of many new VTOL concepts. These vehicles often feature original designs and futuristic shapes. Due to their novelty, the wake characteristics of such aircraft are unknown. However, large wake-induced velocities, should they exist, may be dangerous for any other vehicle evolving in their close proximity. Therefore, improved knowledge about the wakes of VTOL vehicles is needed to guarantee the safety of urban air mobility operations. In this work, we study the wake of three VTOL aircraft in cruise by means of large eddy simulation. We present a two-stage numerical procedure that enables the simulation of long wake ages at a limited computational cost. The analysis of our simulation results reveals that the wakes of rotary vehicles feature larger wake vortex cores than a typical airplane wing. The vortex circulation decay is also faster due to the self-induced turbulence generated during the wake roll-up. Finally, we introduce a model of the vortex circulation distribution that fits the numerical measurements with satisfactory agreement across space and time, and can be used to evaluate induced velocities.

This paper presents the first exploratory effort in developing a data-driven framework to improve the prediction of propeller performance. In this framework, a deep neural network machine learning (ML) model is trained in a multi-fidelity manner using transfer learning (TL) and active learning (AL). The model is first trained using a large number of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity simulations and then enhanced by a small number of high-fidelity aeroacoustic wind tunnel measurements using TL. Additional propellers which were manufactured and experimentally measured were intelligently selected based on an AL algorithm designed to minimize the predictive error of the ML model at two farfield observer locations. In the deployment stage, this ML model enables rapid prediction of the tonal noise level of isolated 2-bladed propellers at two farfield observer locations given the airfoil profile, pitch-to-diameter ratio as well as forward speed and rotational speed of the propeller. Results evaluated based on experimental data from two extra sets of propeller blades, which were held out from the ML training process, indicated that the multi-fidelity ML model trained with both low-and high-fidelity data based on the TL approach delivered more accurate predictions than the ML models trained solely with low-or high-fidelity data. Furthermore, the inclusion of additional high-fidelity dat aset selected by the AL algorithm was shown to further improve to the predictive accuracy of the ML model. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA., All rights reserved.;1

In particular, drone delivery is one of the most attractive applications. The growing number of drones requires appropriate traffic management systems that will rely on cellular networks. However, it has been shown in the literature that these networks cannot provide reliable communication due to low coverage probability and frequent handovers. This article presents a potential solution targeting these problems while requiring no modifications of the existing infrastructure. Namely, equipping the UAV with multiple cellular modems to connect to different providers' networks introduces network diversity resulting in 98% coverage probability at the flight altitude of 100 meters. In contrast, one network ensures only 80% coverage. At the same time, the size of the outage zones becomes up to ten times smaller and the frequency of harmful handovers is reduced to zero. The results are obtained with a physical-layer simulator utilizing a real urban 3D environment, cellular network parameters (e.g., site locations, antenna orientation and gains), and specific aerial channel models. 2022 IEEE.;1

Wind sensors available on the vehicles and located in the air space will become a key necessity for ensuring safe navigation. Conventional anemometers suffer from various drawbacks due to their non-aerodynamic construction, high power consumption, complex signal processing, and cost. An airfoil-shaped low drag anemometer is presented for wind speed and direction measurement on tethered systems such as kites, balloons, and drones. The airfoil anemometer is equipped with a flexible, dual-layer capacitive pressure sensor with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) diaphragm for wind speed and a commercial digital magnetometer for wind direction measurement. The fabrication process for the diaphragm-type capacitive sensor is presented, along with characterization of the sensor in a pressure chamber. The completed sensor is then integrated into a NACA-2412 profile airfoil, along with a commercial magnetometer, for demonstration in a laboratory-scale wind tunnel. 2022 SPIE.;1
10.2514/1.J060886;2022;D.+A.+Smith A.+Filippone G.+N.+Barakos;Noise Source Analysis In Counter-Rotating Open Rotors;Because of their potential to reduce aircraft emissions, counter-rotating open rotors (CRORs) have seen a renewed interest in applications, from civil aviation to urban air mobility. However, there are concerns surrounding their acoustic emissions. In the work presented, the authors investigated the noise sources for a range of CROR configurations for a general aviation class aircraft. Numerical models are used to compute the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of these configurations. Further dissection of the various CROR noise sources is then carried out in order to better understand their contribution to CROR noise, and to direct the design of future low-noise CRORs. Noise reductions were observed when the rotorrotor spacing was increased. Increased contraction of the wake requires the need for increased clipping to reduce the tip vortex interaction source. Noise reductions were also observed in the case of asynchronous rotational speeds. However, this was accompanied by a reduction in propulsive efficiency. Analysis of the CROR in nonaxial flight demonstrated the need to evaluate noise-reducing strategies at off-design conditions. Although the analysis proved the ability to reduce various CROR noise sources, it highlighted that tradeoffs with aerodynamic performance is necessary. 2022, AIAA International.

General trends and the predicted advent of personal aerial vehicles increase traffic rapidly, but current air traffic management methods admittedly cannot scale appropriately. A hierarchical system is proposed to overcome the problem, the middle layer of which is elaborated in this paper. This layer aims to enable stochastic control of traffic behaviour using a single parameter, which is achieved by applying distributed stochastic task allocation. The task allocation algorithm is used to allocate speeds to vehicles in a scalable way. By regulating the speed distribution of vehicles the conflict rates remain manageable. Multi-Agent simulation results show that it is possible to control ensemble dynamics and together with that traffic safety and throughput via a single parameter. Using transient simulations the dynamic performance of the system is analysed. It is shown that the traffic conflict reduction problem can be transformed into a control design problem.

10.2514/6.2022-2165;2022;M.+J.+Groom Q.+Wang B.+Y.+Zhou;A Mid-Fidelity Numerical Framework For Efficient Predictioof Propeller-Wing Interaction Noise;Aerodynamic noise is an important design consideration for many aircraft, including Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems that are expected to operate in particularly close proximity to people. This paper attempts to address the need for computationally efficient methods that can predict aerodynamic noise generated by complex aircraft configurations and inform early design decisions. We present a mid-fidelity framework based on coupling an source panel method-vortex particle method with a solid surface Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings method for farfield noise prediction. We first consider an isolated propeller benchmark case from Casalino et al. (2021) to validate our method against experimental and numerical results, and then we apply it to a simple propeller-wing interaction problem. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

10.2514/6.2022-2167;2022;S.+A.+Rizzi M.+Rafaelof;Second-Generation Uam Community Noise Assessment Using The Faa Aviation Environmental Design Tool;Vehicles serving the urban air mobility (UAM) market are anticipated to operate in communities close to the public at large. The approved model for assessing environmental impact of air traffic actions in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administrations Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT), does not support analysis of such operations due to a combined lack of a UAM aircraft performance model and aircraft noise data. This paper discusses second-generation developments to assess the acoustic impact of UAM fleet operations on the community using AEDT and demonstrates its use for representative UAM operations. In particular, methods were developed to add broadband self noise into computed noise-power-distance data, and vertiport-centric operations were evaluated for two concept vehicles. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

10.2514/6.2022-1295;2022;M.+C.+Walker D.+Cuppoletti;Investigation Into Aeroacoustic Rotor Scaling Effects For Evtol Applications;Over the past couple of years there has been an increased interest for urban air mobility in both human and package transportation. This study will evaluate the propulsive and acoustic effects of several dual blade rotors ranging in diameter from 12.5  30.5 and triple blade from 12.5  24.5. Over the course of testing thrust, torque, RPM/rotor tip speed and sound pressure measurements were conducted. These measurements showed various differences across the acoustic spectrum. In this text the OASPL, Power Spectral Density and the Decoupling of Tonal and Broadband Acoustics are discussed. Through these analyses it was observed that triple blade rotors have a lower OASPL at higher tip Mach speeds than their dual rotor equivalents. As rotor blade diameter and blade number are increased the broadband levels begin to differ, with the triple blade rotors having higher levels. And lastly, a strong need for understanding loaded motor noise is brought to attention as a change in motor can have a profound effect on the overall acoustic spectrum. If this is the case for small quadcopters, one can only imagine how much worse this could be with larger aircraft. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These xTM concepts assume the ability to fly in airspace that is authorized to operate solely under xTM services and mostly without any air traffic control (ATC) support. However, they also assume circumstances in which the xTM vehicles would need to operate in conventional ATC-managed airspace, both during nominal and off-nominal scenarios. Due to the vast differences in the xTM vehicle performances and missions, there is a concern that ATC may have difficulty in safely managing the xTM traffic and providing appropriate services to all vehicles, unless a consistent set of roles, procedures, and data exchange requirements are defined across the diverse set of xTM vehicle operations. In this paper, we describe a set of use cases that have been identified in UTM, AAM/UAM, and ETM operations that are related to ATC interactions, and we propose to categorize these use cases across xTM domains based on common trigger events. Organizing the use cases from the perspective of ATC roles per each trigger event is expected to provide the first step in discovering common procedures and data requirements across xTM domains that could help ease the controllers cognitive task load and allow them to manage these interactions more safely. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

Urban Air Mobility requires rules and regulations in a traffic scenario so as to deploy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in urban areas.Geo-fencing is a critical component of the UAV system as it designates the strict boundaries of the lanes and sub-lanes for safety and smooth flow of UAV traffic. In this work, a novel approach for representation of geofencing using Signed Distance Functions (SDF) is presented. A geofence repulsion strategy, so that UAV does not collide with various proposed geofencing layers, and violation check using the trajectory planning strategy are proposed to ensure smooth flow of drones in the airspace. These methods are developed for CORRIDRONE, an architecture for authorizing drones in the controlled airspace, but are general enough to be used in other air mobility systems too. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

As a result, this data-driven approach is currently experiencing massive interest in all industry domains. This increased use also applies for the safety critical aviation domain. With no human pilot on board, the potential use cases of machine learning for unmanned aircraft are particularly promising. Even upcoming Urban Air Mobility concepts are planning to remove the onboard pilot and instead use machine learning to support a remote pilot, possibly supervising a fleet of vehicles. However, the verification of machine learning algorithms is a challenging problem, since established safety standards and assurance methods are not applicable. Thus, this work comprises a literature study on the topic of machine learning verification and safety. This research paper uses a systematic approach to map and categorize the research and focuses on specific subtopics that are of particular interest in the context of existing guidance documents. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Wake vortex modeling approaches for fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft are investigated. A wake age model is developed that accounts for the temporal and spatial dissipation of the wake-induced downwash. A wake vortex model is developed for rotorcraft that accounts for blade flapping motion and cyclic pitch control to reduce the lift asymmetry. This in turn results in an equal lift circulation strength on the advancing side and retreating side of the rotor. Two wake vortex interaction simulations are performed to illustrate the modeling approaches. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.;1
10.2514/6.2022-1084;2022;D.+Milz G.+Looye;Tilt-Wing Control Design For A Unified Control Concept;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) promises an economic and ecological solution for the growing mobility demand by utilizing Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing Vehicles (eVTOLs). Tilt-wing eVTOLs (e.g., Airbus A3 Vahana) appear to be the most promising ones because they offer an efficient wing-borne cruise flight while reducing the need for ground-based infrastructure at the cost of a complex control task. Tilt-wing vehicles increase the pilots workload and introduce possible human and technical failures due to mechanical complexity. A unified control concept shall be able to handle the vehicle in every phase and provides a single clean and intuitive interface. This work develops a controller capable of decoupling the physical couplings of the flight dynamics. An integrated six-degree-of-freedom rigid body model in a compact mathematical representation is proposed, and flight control requirements are identified. An Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) controller is designed which fulfills the requirements. Moreover, multiple command filters and outer-loop controllers are designed to handle different control modes and provide a proof-of-concept for a unified control scheme. Finally, the closed-loop system is evaluated by means of the control requirements and a generic UAM mission. The closed-loop system masters all parts of the mission and fulfills these requirements. The developed dynamic model and control system will be valuable for future tilt-wing eVTOL research, especially subsequent works on unified control systems. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

Next, energy consumption and flight duration results are compared for flying at the wind-optimal airspeed and best-range airspeed on a great-circle cruise segment under different wind conditions. Finally, the difference in energy consumption when flying to meet the assigned required time of arrival based on actual wind conditions vs. predicted wind conditions are examined and compared for the two airspeed modes (wind-optimal and best-range) for different values of wind magnitude uncertainty. The results show operational benefits of flying at the wind-optimal cruise airspeed compared to the best-range airspeed, especially under strong headwind conditions from both an energy consumption and flight duration perspective. The results also show that flying at wind-optimal airspeed under wind magnitude uncertainty has lower variability and higher predictability of energy consumption than flying at best-range airspeed. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-0260;2022;A.+A.+Markov M.+V.+Bendarkar D.+N.+Mavris;Improved Hazard Analysis For Novel Vehicle Configurations Using The Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis;Novel aircraft, especially ones that utilize Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP), are becoming increasingly popular for future aviation markets like Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The use of all electric propulsion systems promises more efficient aircraft that produce zero emissions. A large variety of concepts have been proposed including electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) and short take-off and landing (STOL) concepts with large variations in number of propulsors, number of wings, tilting mechanisms, and aerodynamic design. However, complex aircraft architectures also introduce a significant amount of uncertainty and safety concerns for designers and future passengers. In order for the aircraft to become certifiable, they must meet strict safety requirements and be designed with safety in mind because designers cannot rely on historical data. This is especially important when considering that the complexity of the software on the vehicles is increasing and many vehicles are likely to be flown autonomously. To address the safety concerns, this work presents an integrated hazard analysis approach that utilizes the Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to supplement a continuous functional hazard analysis (C-FHA). This approach is implemented for the propulsion system of a Test-Distributed Electric Propulsion (T-DEP) aircraft inspired by the NASA X-57 to illustrate the unsafe design characteristics and hazards that are overlooked by more traditional methods. This approach promises to identify unsafe design characteristics of novel aircraft systems and can be used to analyze systems such as avionics and autonomy that are otherwise overlooked in traditional safety analyses. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-0015;2022;H.+U.+Koyuncuoglu P.+He;Coupled Wing-Propeller Aerodynamic Optimization Using The Adjoint Method;Increasing attention to urban air mobility with electric propulsion causes an increased interest in propeller aircraft design and optimization. Various studies have been focusing on optimizing the aerodynamic performance of wings and propellers. However, existing aerodynamic optimization studies optimized the wing and propeller separately. In this study, we develop the capability to simultaneously optimize the wing and propeller. We use a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics solver to simulate the wing aerodynamics, and the propeller is modelled by adding an actuator disk in the flow field. We develop a smoothed actuator disk formulation that allows us to change the location and radius of the propeller during the optimization, along with the wing shape. We use the discrete adjoint approach to compute the derivatives and couple it with a gradient-based optimization framework. The above adjoint-based optimization framework can use a large number of design variables to allow a large design freedom for both wing and propeller. We perform a total of nine aerodynamic optimizations with various propeller parameters as the design variables. We also consider optimization with single and double propeller configurations. We observe that the spanwise location and the outer radius are the two most important parameters for the propeller, and using more propeller parameters as the design variables generally result in larger wing drag reduction. For example, optimizing the wing shape while allowing the actuator location and outer radius to move results in more than 20% wing drag reduction, compared with the baseline design. This study serves as the starting point for more detailed high-fidelity wing-propeller aerodynamic optimizations. 2022 by MBDA UK Ltd.

This paper analyzes and discusses the attributes that create discrepancies across descriptions as to arrive at a definition of UAM that can be agreed upon all stakeholders. This will be key for aligning research efforts and allow the concept to evolve in the right direction. 2022 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V.;1

10.3390/en14248344;2021;D.+Sziroczk D.+Rohcs;Automated Conflict Management Framework Development For Autonomous Aerial And Ground Vehicles;The number of aerial-and ground-based unmanned vehicles and operations is expected to significantly expand in the near future. While aviation traditionally has an excellent safety record in managing conflicts, the current approaches will not be able to provide safe and efficient operations in the future. This paper presents the development of a novel framework integrating autonomous aerial and ground vehicles to facilitate short-and mid-term tactical conflict management. The methodology presents the development of a modular web service framework to develop new conflict management algorithms. This new framework is aimed at managing urban and peri-urban traffic of unmanned ground vehicles and assisting the introduction of urban air mobility into the same framework. A set of high-level system requirements is defined. The incremental development of two versions of the system prototype is presented. The discussions highlight the lessons learnt while implementing and testing the conflict management system and the introduced version of the stop-and-go resolution algorithm and defines the identified future development directions. Operation of the system was successfully demonstrated using real hardware. The developed framework implements short-and mid-term conflict management methodologies in a safe, resource efficient and scalable manner and can be used for the further development and the evaluation of various methods integrating aerial-and ground-based autonomous vehicles. 2021 by the authors.

10.3390/atmos12111424;2021;R.+Kapoor N.+Kloet A.+Gardi A.+Mohamed R.+Sabatini;Sound Propagation Modelling For Manned And Unmanned Aircraft Noise Assessment And Mitigation: A Review;This paper addresses one of the recognized barriers to the unrestricted adoption of Unmanned Aircraft (UA) in mainstream urban usenoiseand reviews existing approaches for estimating and mitigating this problem. The aircraft noise problem is discussed upfront in general terms by introducing the sound emission, propagation, and psychoacoustic effects. The propagation of sound in the atmosphere, which is the focus of this paper, is then analysed in detail to isolate the environmental and operational factors that predominantly influence the perceived noise on the ground, especially looking at largescale lowaltitude UA operations, such as in the envisioned Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts. The physics of sound propagation are presented, considering all attenuation effects and the anomalies due to Doppler and atmospheric effects, such as wind, thermal inversion, and turbulence. The analysis allows to highlight the limitations of current mainstream aircraft noise modelling and certification approaches and, in particular, their inadequacy in addressing the noise of UA and, more generally, UAM vehicles. This finding is important considering that, although reducing noise at the source has remained a priority for manufacturers to enable the scaling up of UAM and drone delivery operations in the near future, the impact of poorly considered propagation and psychoacoustic effects on the actual perceived noise on the ground is equally important for the same objective. For instance, optimizing the flight paths as a function of local weather conditions can significantly contribute to minimizing the impact of noise on communities, thus paving the way for the introduction of fullscale UAM operations. A more reliable and accurate modelling of noise ground signatures for both manned and unmanned lowflying aircraft will aid in identifying the realtime data stream requirements from distributed sensors on the ground. New developments in surrogate sound propagation models, more pervasive realtime sensor data, and suitable computing resources are expected to both yield more reliable and effective estimates of noise reaching the ground listeners and support a dynamic planning of flight paths. 2021 by the authors.

Air taxi services could be a solution to this growing problem by bringing the existing transportation system to the three dimensional space. This paper analyzes the challenges and requirements of developing a vertiport intended for the use of air taxis at Cologne Bonn Airport. This research was conducted with the information available at the time of writing, for which a basis scenario is defined for the Cologne Bonn Airport where important aspects of an air taxi service are determined such as passenger demand and possible vehicles. The main aspects analysed were the requirements on the vertiport infrastructure and its location, as well as the requirements on passenger processing. For the defined basis scenario, results show that the preferential locations to develop a vertiport at Cologne Bonn Airport are the roof top levels of parking garages P2 and P3. Furthermore, it is shown that given the estimated passenger demand, a very high utilization factor of the defined infrastructure is to be expected. This paper provides a starting point for the development of an air taxi service at Cologne Bonn Airport. Further research is needed in key issues such as the financial aspects of an air taxi service, its integration into the current operating scenario of the Cologne Bonn Airport and the approval process for an air taxi service and the vertiport itself. 2021, The Author(s).;1
10.4204/EPTCS.348.5;2021;S.+Paul S.+Patterson C.+Varela;Formal Guarantees Of Timely Progress For Distributed Knowledge Propagation;Autonomous air traffic management (ATM) operations for urban air mobility (UAM) will necessitate the use of distributed protocols for decentralized coordination between aircraft. As UAM operations are time-critical, it will be imperative to have formal guarantees of progress for the distributed protocols used in ATM. Under asynchronous settings, message transmission and processing delays are unbounded, making it impossible to provide deterministic bounds on the time required to make progress. We present an approach for formally guaranteeing timely progress in a Two-Phase Acknowledge distributed knowledge propagation protocol by probabilistically modeling the delays using theories of the Multicopy Two-Hop Relay protocol and the M/M/1 queue system. The guarantee states a probabilistic upper bound to the time for progress as a function of the probabilities of the total transmission and processing delays being less than two given values. We also showcase the development of a library of formal theories, that is tailored towards reasoning about timely progress in distributed protocols deployed in airborne networks, in the Athena proof assistant.

10.3390/su131910612;2021;K.+Desai C.+Al C.+Antoniou;Roadmap To Early Implementation Of Passenger Air Mobility: Findings From A Delphi Study;Urban air mobility (UAM) has recently increased in popularity as an emerging mode of transportation, covering a wide range of applications, for on-demand or scheduled operations of smaller aircraft, in and around metropolitan areas. Due to its novelty and as it has not yet been implemented, UAM research still faces uncertainties. In particular, there is a need to develop a roadmap for the early implementation of passenger air mobility, aiming to identify the most prominent challenges, opportunities, hazards, and risks, but also to highlight the most promising use cases, or on the contrary, the ones associated with the least benefits compared to the risks or complexity they entail. To answer the previous questions, and therefore address this research gap, this study used a two-round Delphi questionnaire, targeting various stakeholder groups (product owners, policymakers, researchers, consultants, investors), leading to a total of 51 experts, out of which 34 also participated in the second round. In the first round, the main challenges, opportunities, and hazards facing the implementation of passenger UAM were identified. Findings on challenges and opportunities that were dependent on use cases only (as opposed to being dependent on technology or external factors) were then fed back into the second round, which helped evaluate the use cases based both on their complexities, as well as the associated benefits. Accordingly, medical/emergency was identified as the best use case and intracity transport as the worst (in terms of complexity vs. benefits). Similarly, a risk analysis evaluated the potential hazards associated with the implementation of UAM and their impacts on the system viability. Community backlash was found to be the most hazardous one, while malicious passenger behavior and improperly designed infrastructure as the least. Findings from this study can help better understand stakeholders opinions, highlighting promising use cases, but also risks to be aware of, constituting therefore a roadmap for future implementation. 2021 by the authors.

One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed online. We propose Learning-N-Flying (LNF), a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance (CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on the fly, and allows autonomous Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)s managed by different operators to safely carry out complex missions, represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for two UASs as a mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online. Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining (1) learning-based decision-making and (2) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF extends L2F to cases where there are more than two UASs on a collision path. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online (computation time in the order of milliseconds) and under certain assumptions has failure rates of less than 1% in the worst case, improving to near 0% in more relaxed operations. We show the applicability of our scheme to a wide variety of settings through multiple case studies. 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.;1

Mission performing by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) within an urban environment has multiple hazards including collision with a ground, artificial construction, and other airspace users. Separation minimums identify a safety boundary for each flying object to ensure the target level of flight safety in Urban Air Mobility. An approach of separation minimums selection based on performance of UAV on-board positioning system has been proposed in the paper. Performance-based approach for separation minimums selection takes into account errors of positioning methods, which mainly depends on surrounding environment. Values of separation minimums have been estimated based on performance of available UAV equipment. 2021 IEEE.;1

Existing risk-aware trajectory planning approaches minimize the risk by determining trajectories that might result in less damage in the case of failure. However, the risk of the loss of thrust can be eliminated by executing a safe emergency landing if a landing site is reachable. Therefore, we propose a novel risk-aware trajectory planning that minimizes the risk to people on the ground while an option of a safe emergency landing in the case of loss of thrust is guaranteed. The proposed method has been empirically evaluated on a realistic urban scenario. Based on the reported results, an improvement in the risk reduction is achieved compared to the shortest and risk-aware only trajectory. The proposed risk-aware planning with safe emergency landing seems to be suitable trajectory planning for urban air mobility. 2021 IEEE.;1

As a new type of transportation mode, Urban Air Mobility (UAM) will bring vitality to the development of future cities. However, the existing air traffic management system cannot meet the on-demand operation development requirements of future UAM, necessitating the establishment of a new future-oriented UAM management system based on the characteristics of UAM. This paper first briefly summarizes the origin, rise and development prospects of UAM with an overview of the development process, followed by the design of the operation concept of UAM, and the future UAM framework of China combined with the current characteristics of China's Air Traffic Control. The current research status of UAM management is systematically reviewed from four aspects: airspace planning, flow control, traffic services and infrastructure. Finally, to provide reference for in-depth research and rapid development of UAM management, the challenges faced by UAM management and some relevant suggestions are presented combined with the demand for future UAM development. 2021, Beihang University Aerospace Knowledge Press.

As the aerodynamic performance and flight stability characteristics can be significantly affected by multiple-propeller operation, aerodynamic analysis reflecting the power-on effect is required for design/development. Simulating all propellers using the general computational fluid dynamics is inefficient in terms of computational time and cost. Therefore, this study evaluates the practicality of actuator methods in the aerodynamic analysis of two aircrafts with multiple propellers: a quad tilt propeller (QTP) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an optionally piloted personal air vehicle (OPPAV) of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI). The normal and side forces generated by the propellers under various angle of attack and sideslip angle conditions are found to be the most contributing factors to the deterioration in the aircraft longitudinal and directional static stabilities, respectively. The forces and moments generated by the propellers are found to make both longitudinal and directional stabilities of the QTP UAV unstable. However, the OPPAV appears to remain stable state even with the operating propellers. We conclude that actuator methods, being computationally efficient in terms of cost, time, and accuracy, possess great potential for aerodynamic analysis in various related industries. 2021 The Authors;1

A large focus in recent years has been on adaptable collision avoidance systems capable of avoiding fixed and airborne traffic. This paper presents flight test validation of an adaptive collision algorithm known as the morphing potential field algorithm. The morphing potential field algorithm has been modified to allow implementation of more advanced guidance logics such as L_{2}^{+} guidance. The aim is to validate the morphing collision avoidance path planning algorithm in a complex scenario, with multiple aircraft-two fixed wing and two rotary wing-flying the same spatially constrained area. The aircraft were intentionally put in a collision course with each other and other obstacles. Validation flight tests were successfully conducted to assess performance of morphing potential field navigation algorithms and also to quantify the impact of possible communication delays on the safety of collision avoidance methods for high speed and high inertia aircraft. 2021 IEEE.;1

The reliability of such critical systems is therefore key to ensure high safety standards in the low-altitude airspace. Diagnostic systems, which aim at identifying incipient faults, can mitigate unexpected failures or lower-than-expected reliability by performing early fault detection by monitoring the systems. A key element of fault diagnosis is fault detection and isolation (FDI), which complexity increases with the complexity of the system itself, namely the number of subsystems and components,interactions among sub-systems, and the number of sensors available. The proposed approach leverages combination of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) integrated with Bayesian networks, thus introducing dependability structures into a diagnostic framework to aid FDI. Faults and failure events from the FMEA are mapped within a Bayesian network, where network edges replicate the links embedded within FMEAs. The integrated framework enables the fault isolation process by identifying the probability of occurrence of specific faults or root causes given evidence observed through sensor signals. In this work, sub-systems of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) type vehicle like avionics, structures, power-train etc are taken into account to show the approach at the system level. This work integrates early design phase in the development of UAM type vehicles with diagnostic tools, which are often developed later in the product life-cycle, or retrofitted at a later time on systems. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) derived for the system in the design phase is embedded within a Bayesian network (BN). 2021 IEEE.;1

The drivetrain includes a turboshaft engine and two electric machines, fed by a lithium ion battery. In previous works, some of the authors developed a simple but thorough modelling approach for the electric path of the power system that was validated by means of experimental data from literature. In this investigation simulation results from the Gas-turbine Simulation Program (GSP) commercial environment were used to develop and validate an off design model for the turboshaft. The second innovative contribution of the paper is the application of Dynamic Programming to four different missions of the helicopter to quantify the fuel saving potentiality of hybridization and also as benchmark for future online control strategies. A constraint was considered in the investigation to allow at any time the electric backup in case of engine failure. The results of DPM showed that it is possible to obtain a reduction of fuel burn from 12% to 24% (with respect to using only the engine to move the rotor) depending on the specification of the mission and the state of health of the battery. Moreover, it was proved that charging the battery on board is not necessary in this kind of application. 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.;1
N/A;2021;R.+Brhl H.+Fricke M.+Schultz;Air Taxi Flight Performance Modeling And Application;Urban air mobility encompasses the idea of extending urban transportation to the airspace. For this purpose, several aircraft manufacturers and start-up companies have developed aircraft concepts for flying completely electrical. Electric aircraft have different behavior concerning flight performance, which mostly depends on battery characteristics. Due to this, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL) are more limited in their flight performance concerning range and endurance than conventional aircraft. Nowadays data on that topic are mostly published by eVTOL manufacturers and seem to be quite ambitious concerning the current state of battery technology. This paper aims at determining flight performance by considering state-of-the-art battery characteristics. Each flight segment has a different influence on battery discharge, due to different power requirements. Based on an application case, the range capabilities of three eVTOLs are estimated. Therefore, the results reveal a range of around 115 km for vectored thrust eVTOL, around 70 km for lift & cruise eVTOL, and around 50 km for multicopter eVTOL. ATM 2021. All rights reserved.;1

Traditionally, micro-launchers have much higher launch costs per kilogram compared to bigger launchers. However, today the cornerstone of the emerging micro-satellite market is the economic viability of launching smaller payloads into dedicated orbits, at high frequency. The Recovery and Return to Base (RRTB) project, as part of the European Union's H2020 program, aims to develop a novel solution to provide tailored cost-effective access to space for the micro satellite market. The MESO vehicle is a unique system solution to achieve partial reusability of a micro-launcher. The two-stage vehicle injects the payload into orbit, similar to classical expendable launchers. However, the separated first stage becomes a re-entry vehicle that performs a series of maneuvers to return safely to the ground. Firstly, the MESO performs a boost-back burn using its methalox fueled aerospike engine, which decelerates the vehicle and points the re-entry trajectory towards a selected landing site. A hypersonic drag device is deployed to decelerate the ballistic re-entry vehicle to supersonic speeds. Having descended through the upper atmosphere, the MESO engages its novel propulsion system for guided landing. Current technologies for landing a reusable rocket launcher have some well-known drawbacks. While retro-propulsion is powerful it involves major technological challenges. Horizontal landing requires safe and large touchdown areas. Collaborative solutions, such as mid-air helicopter retrieval, increase cost and involve personnel. MESO capitalizes on recent advances in urban air mobility and battery technology. It has two banks of commercial of-the-shelf Electric Ducted Fans (EDFs) mounted on the vehicle. Using electric propulsion the MESO navigates to the landing site, where it performs a controlled hover landing on a small 10x10 m footprint. The MESO targets a minimum reuse of 10 flights, which implies that many considerations have to be taken into account regarding the design of e.g., the main cryogenic propellant tanks, the vehicle's primary structure, and the thermal protection system to allow for an optimal post-flight refurbishment and inspection. 2021 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

10.2514/6.2021-2208;2021;J.+D.+Cluts D.+L.+Huff B.+S.+Henderson C.+Ruggeri;Surface Vibration Measurement And Analysis For Uam/Uas Electric Motor Noise;Urban Air Mobility vehicles are an emerging class of vertical lift vehicles using electric motors to drive multiple rotors for lift. The outrunner electric motors that are commonly used, may be capable of generating noise that could contribute to the vehicles overall noise profile and could generate cabin noise. Understanding and predicting the noise requires more knowledge of the rotor vibrations and eventually a model to predict the frequencies of those vibrations. This work presents a measurement of the rotor vibrations of two different small-scale motors. Two techniques to measure the surface vibration were used. The displacement spectra are compared with acoustic measurements. A finite element analysis model is used to predict the rotor resonance frequencies. The predicted frequencies are in fair agreement with the experimentally observed vibration frequencies, but requires further work to understand discrepancies. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

However, before any of these vehicles see commercial flight they must be certified by the civil aviation authorities. The Federal Aviation Administration in the United States and the European Aviation Safety Agency in Europe are currently in the process of developing appropriate certification procedures. Instead of only focusing on creating new certification requirements, both agencies are looking into the option of adjusting present certifications for light aircraft. In particular, the FAA considers adjusting the Part 23 airworthiness standards with special conditions to allow for certification of eVTOL Urban Air Mobility vehicles (UAM). One of the hurdles prohibiting the use of Part 23 for certification of eVTOL vehicles is proper power and energy management. It must be ensured at all times that the vehicle has sufficient power available to perform critical flight maneuvers, sufficient energy stored in its batteries to safely complete the flight, and that this information is continuously communicated to the pilot or a control system. If the estimate of the power required to maintain a flight state or the energy required to safely complete a maneuver exceeds the available reserves, the pilot must be warned and provided with a suggested plan of actions. The aviation authorities also need tools to verify statements made by the aircraft manufacturers pertaining to achievable flight performance, range and safety margins, in order to assist them in the flight safety assessment and airworthiness certification process. The purpose of the model presented in this paper is to serve as first-principle model capable of calculating power and energy requirements for variety of electric eVTOL vehicle designs operating in user-specified conditions. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Electric machines and drives have been identified as limiting component subsystems with failure rates in the vicinity of 10-6 failures per hour. Fault-tolerant (FT) machine drives offers a promising approach to improve reliability using existing technology. A FT Integrated Modular Motor Drive (IMMD) design is proposed for a quadrotor UAM application, and its estimated reliability is studied using Markov chains. It is shown that the lower bound on its catastrophic failure rate is limited to its single-point failure rate (e.g., bearings) when a rapid repair strategy is applied. This insight highlights the importance of aggressively minimizing the IMMD's single-point failure rate. Markov analysis shows how suppression of single-point failures results in major reductions in the IMMD failure rate exceeding 1000x as the single-point failure rate is driven towards its ideal limiting value of zero. 2021 AIAA.;1

UAM has potential to bring new services related to both passengers and logistic/freight mobility (like passenger carrying air taxis or small package delivery drones) as well as enable better resilience in emergency situations resulting due to various causes (for example, traffic accidents, traffic congestion, catastrophic events and others). Such new services, accelerated thanks to the recent introduction of Vertical Take-Off Landing (VTOL) capable vehicles, able to need less air space to take-off or landing, have the possibility to transform the way people move within, around and between urban areas by shortening commute times, bypassing ground mobility congestion and enabling specific and oriented point-to-point flight across the cities. As currently the UAM integrations are still hindered by a number of constraints, in this paper we provide an overview of UAM legislative frameworks, with particular focus on European Union (EU), together with the overview of the most relevant UAM case studies and the potential new UAM services. 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;1

High performance compact thermal devices are needed for existing and emerging aerospace systems, which include commercial/military, hybrid-electric, urban air mobility and high-speed air vehicles, among others. Advances in additive manufacturing (AM), materials, and design processes play a critical role in development of next-generation AM-enabled heat exchanger technology. This paper reports recent Boeing-led breakthrough advances in thin-wall (150 - 175 microns) metallic AM and its use in conformal heat exchangers and cold plates for aircraft engine precooler and electronic cooling applications, respectively. A model based engineering (MBE) approach is used in developing highly efficient AM heat exchanger designs. Their performance benefits are validated using a complimentary numerical simulation and experimental performance measurement method. The measured heat exchanger effectiveness and pressure drop in AM-produced brick-shaped and conformal heat exchangers are in good agreement with model predictions, within ~5% and 20%, respectively. An overview of steps required for achieving technical maturity and production readiness of metal AM heat exchanger and cold plate technology, along with an envisioned roadmap for adoption of this technology in aviation platforms, is presented.

In recent years, the concept of Urban Air Mobility has been put forward by large companies and organizations as a way to address this problem, and this approach has been rapidly gaining ground. This disruptive technology involves aerial vehicles (AVs) for hire that can be utilized by customers to travel between locations within large cities. This concept has the potential to drastically decrease traffic congestion and reduce air pollution, since these vehicles typically use electric motors powered by batteries. This work studies the problem of scheduling the assignment of AVs to customers, having as a goal to maximize the serviced customers and minimize the energy consumption of the AVs by forcing them to fly at the lowest possible altitude. Initially, an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is presented, that is solved offline and optimally, followed by a near-optimal offline algorithm, that solves the problem incrementally, one AV at a time, to address scalability issues, allowing scheduling in problems involving large numbers of locations, AVs, and customer requests. 2021 IEEE.;1

With the expected advent of new entrants including Unmanned Aerial Systems, Commercial Launch Vehicles and Urban Air Mobility aircraft, the future United States National Airspace System will have to evolve to include their operations along with the current commercial, general aviation and military operations. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration are working together to provide a vision for aviation operations in the future2045 and beyond. Their National Airspace System Horizons initiative seeks to provide stakeholders a list of operational scenarios and technologies, concepts and strategies needed for supporting that vision. They have identified cybersecurity as one of the seven strategic interest areas for realizing this vision. Consequently, NASA is studying cyber resiliency for secure airspace operations. While there are many pathways to attack a cyber physical system such as Urban Air Mobility, their effect is expressed in modification or corruption of data/information used for controlling vehicles and making operational decisions. The paper describes cybersecurity technologies of Encryption, Blockchain, Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure, Trusted Platform Module and Anomaly Detection for protecting the data, and the cyber resiliency of the current and future air traffic management system. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

A modular stator configuration (i.e., breaking the machine into multiple three-phase groups) is a promising approach for achieving high levels of stator and power electronics fault tolerance. This paper proposes a stator configuration using double-layer concentrated windings that offers an improved tradeoff between the electromagnetic isolation characteristics of individual modules and their power density metrics compared to previously reported modular stator configurations. The proposed stator structure utilizes a unique stator tooth tip structure that increases the leakage inductance. The post-fault performance characteristics of the new configuration have been investigated via simulation for both open-circuit and short-circuit faults. These results demonstrate that the healthy module exhibits very little impact when either fault type is applied to an adjacent module, even during the initial transient period following the fault application. The modular motor approach is applied to a quadrotor aircraft application and analyzed for both healthy and faulted operation. The machine is estimated to achieve 14.1 kW/kg active power density and 96.0% efficiency during rated operation at 70 kW, 8000 rpm. 2021 IEEE.;1

Flight trials of Air Taxis pave the way for Urban Air Mobility (UAM). However, the greater challenge resides in formulating the Urban Air Traffic Management (UATM) structure and procedures to enable multiple aircraft to safely navigate their way in urban skies. The key technologies enabling UATM are Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) systems. This paper presents a proposed configuration for CNS System to support UATM. Aircraft for UAM are supposed to operate within the aerial bounds of the cities away from conventional air traffic. Thus air traffic would be much denser and the Air Traffic Management (ATM) system required to control air mobility must provide integrity, robustness, security and high geo-spatial accuracy. Additionally, there is also a need for fast and accurate communication between traffic controller and the air vehicle. Communication requirements for UAM include Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vertiport to vertiport and Vertiport to Vehicle communication. Navigation requires Self-positioning and Situational-awareness. Surveillance needs to be able to perform Ground stations detecting and tracking aircraft, position and Identification updates. The paper presents the concept of operation, architecture of CNS systems fulfilling these requirements. The region of flight operations is the capital city of Islamabad and adjoining regions. The viability of the proposed structure is verified through simulations carried out in GNU Octave software. 2021 IEEE.;1

NASA, in partnership with FAA and industry, approaches these complexities with research and development activities such as flight tests and simulations, in order to better understand the impacts and necessary mechanisms by which these operations could be integrated. One example of such research and development activity that NASA is conducting is the Advanced Air Mobility National Campaign effort. Flight-test scenarios were proposed as part of the National Campaign and tested in simulation for evaluation with industry partners prior to the flight test.

These requirements are estimated considering different factors such as airspace structure and possible landing trajectories, navigation performance, and wind conditions. A preliminary assessment of the level of maturity of the available technologies is obtained as a result of the comparison of the EVS state of the art and the estimated visual requirements for the UAM scenarios. Finally, the performance of sensing systems fulfilling the previously defined requirements is assessed within a numerical simulation framework able to realistically reproduce UAM landing scenarios including trajectory/attitude disturbances. Specifically, visual-based techniques for pose estimation with respect to a vertiport are developed and then integrated within a multi-sensor fusion architecture combining other sources such as inertial sensors. 2021 IEEE.;1

Safe paths with respect to fixed and moving obstacles are defined for a set of UAVs by accounting for navigation and control errors in the definition of the minimum separations. Strategic path definition consists in two steps, i.e., global and local planning, which are aimed first at defining the path to avoid fixed obstacles, and then at refining it accounting for the deconfliction with moving obstacles, respectively. Deconfliction is handled by dealing with time varying occupancy maps where the moving obstacles are represented by their actual trajectory inflated with safety margins and 4D trajectory (position and time) errors. GNSS coverage and UAV on-board equipment, i.e., navigation system performance, impact positioning errors and thus the margins considered in the planning process. Therefore, better equipped UAVs are expected to enable more efficient replanning and airspace utilization. The algorithm is tested in a simulation scenario taken from real world environment and chosen with the aim of highlighting navigation issues at the (low) altitudes where the UAVs are demanded to fly. 2021 IEEE.;1

Another type of vehicle used is the Unmanned air vehicle (UAV), which doesn't need user (human) control. The future of the development of this technology is the use of these vehicles to make deliveries and transportation of people and many others, having many vehicles making transit in small areas, leading to traffic jams. Despite this, most research focuses on scenarios with only one or a few agents. These scenarios, however, do not reflect the reality expected in the future, including multiple aircraft controlled by different entities, with diverse goals. These scenarios, mainly urban and used in dense areas, with many vehicles having to share the same air space, the normal Air Traffic Management (ATM) could not handle this new traffic, of hundreds of small and autonomous vehicles, in a central city region, this requires specific rules that have been called UAM (Urban Air Mobility). Bringing issues as safety and rules regarding the organization of this new system. This work aims to present scenarios using computer simulations created based on a multi-agent simulation tool or a Multi-Agent System (MAS). The MAS has the advantage that we could create and simulate more powerfully the existence of multiple vehicles (or agents) that act independently, as would happen in a real situation. This tool uses the Netlogo language and allows the modeling of multiple UAVs with stochastic trajectories created in a decentralized way, verifying how the model deals with conflicts and obstacles, highlighting some challenges and capabilities of UAM. Presenting some scenarios, using different parameters, such as aircraft by distinct capacities and in adverse climatic situations. As well, analyzes of results from these simulations conducted to assess the safety and the performance of the process. Using this tool, we propose some testing scenarios and execute some validation using multiple executions with different parameters as the number of planes and velocity to get results as the trajectory time and the number of conflicts. With this data, we try to show that we could estimate the airspace capacity and validate the safety of the given model used parameters. We will show some results of the execution of this tool and try to make some inferences and draw some conclusions based on these results. 2021 IEEE.;1

Electric vertical-takeoff and landing (eVTOL) concept is a potential candidate for urban air mobility platform because of its lower carbon emissions, lower noise generations and potentially lower operational costs. However, such a transportation model is subject to numerous complicated environmental and urban design factors including buildings, dynamic obstacles and micro-weather patterns. In addition, communication, navigation and surveillance quality-of-service and availability would be affected on the overall system performance and resilience. Some social factors such as privacy, noise and visual pollution should also be considered to provide a seamless integration of the urban air mobility applications into the daily life. This paper describes an integrated RRT based approach for designing and executing flight trajectories for urban airspace subject to operating constraints, mission constraints, and environmental conditions. The generated path is energy-efficient and enables aerial vehicle to perform mid-flight landing for battery changing or emergency situations. Moreover, this paper proposes another approach that allows on-the-fly path re-planning under dynamic constraints such as geofences or micro-weather patterns. As such, the approach also provides a method toward contingency operations such as emergency landing on the fly. 2021 IEEE.;1

For this purpose, we integrate a deterministic online planning method into a UAM path planning framework, which operates within precomputed convex regions of obstacle-free space. As part of an offline planning phase, a database of trajectories and convex, obstacle-free regions along these trajectories are computed. During the online phase, transitions between any two preplanned trajectories inside the same region can be computed using a planning method with performance-guaranteed maneuvres. Within a given envelope of environmental disturbances, our method guarantees to contain the flight path inside its convex region, while ensuring deterministic attributes. We demonstrate the method in a scenario representing the intended application and give estimations for offline computation time on desktop-grade hardware. 2021 IEEE.;1

Such congestion instances would increase the time-criticality of UAS Traffic Management (UTM) interventions and likely reduce operational efficiency and safety. Therefore, innovative tools and services are needed to deliver Demand and Capacity Balancing (DCB) services in a range of airspace regions, thus increasing operational efficiency and safety while also reducing the time-criticality of UTM operator's duties. The research presented in this paper aims to develop an efficient and uncertainty-resilient DCB process and solution framework based on hybrid learning algorithms, which allows UTM systems to satisfy the operational requirements of UAS in dense metropolitan regions. The focus of this particular paper is on the analysis of uncertainty factors affecting UAS trajectory conformance in the urban and suburban low-altitude airspace and on the requirements which these factors pose on the determination of recommended DCB processes and techniques. Capitalising on these findings, this research will try to improve the safety, efficiency and uncertainty-resilience of UAS traffic in low-altitude urban airspace operations. 2021 IEEE.;1

Both models are validated independently, and derivatives are verified using finite difference and complex step approximations. These tools are used to analyze and optimize the rotors on the single passenger NASA N+1 quadrotor vehicle with respect to blade-shape parameters. This paper aims to introduce aeroacoustic analysis into gradient-based optimization efficiently and demonstrate the impact that such optimization can have for minimizing the noise footprint of an urban air mobility vehicle. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Higher demands in these operations and the requirement to access urban airspace present new challenges in sUAS operational safety. The presence of Detect and Avoid (DAA) capability of sUAS is one of the major requirements to its safe operation in urban environments according to the current legislation, such as the CAP 722 in the United Kingdom (UK). The platform or its operator proves a full awareness of all potential obstacles within the mission, maintains a safe distance from other airspace users, and, ultimately, performs Collision Avoidance (CA) maneuvers to avoid imminent impacts. Different missions for the defined scenarios are designed and performed within the simulation model in Software Tool Kit (STK) software environment, covering a wide range of practical cases. The acquired data supports assessment of feasibility and requirements to real-time processing. Analysis of the findings and simulation results leads to a holistic approach to implementation of sUAS operations in urban environments, focusing on extracting critical DAA capability for safe mission completion. The proposed approach forms a valuable asset for safe operations validation, enabling better evaluation of risk mitigation for sUAS urban operations and safety-focused design of the sensor payload and algorithms. 2021 IEEE.;1
10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594315;2021;A.+Ahlbrecht U.+Durak;Integrating Safety Into Mbse Processes With Formal Methods;Emerging segments such as Urban Air Mobility require new safety-critical avionic systems. The complexity of these avionic systems has ever been increasing, but even more rapidly in the last two decades in form of the number of components, functions, and interactions. At the same time, demanding time-to-market requirements have to be adhered to by development companies. To cope with these challenges, agile development approaches are required that guarantee safety-by-construction. This paper presents an endeavor to tackle these challenges by holistic utilization of Model-based Systems Engineering, System-Theoretic Process Analysis, and formal methods. The approach is demonstrated in a use-case that analyzes a simplified Collision Avoidance System architecture. Results show that the presented approach is able to improve the development by automating and validating error-prone tasks of the safety assessment. 2021 IEEE.;1

Fully electric air-taxis (car sized vehicles with Vertical Take-off and Landing, VTOL, capabilities) concepts are using the benefits of the scalable properties of electric motors to distribute propulsor units all over the airframe. The large variety of concepts and configurations of these vehicles poses a serious issue in predicting noise generated on the ground. The need for a high-level model to aid in acoustic decision making is evident. Through the demonstrated methodology of computationally deriving Noise - Power - Distance curves for conventional turbo fan aircraft, this paper delivers the capability of dealing with propeller propulsion systems and the associated propeller tonal noise sources to generate the NPDs and therefore noise exposure maps. The aims can be broken down into two objectives: a) demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed propeller harmonics noise scaling laws to calculate noise variation from a baseline scenario and b) incorporate the scaling components into the larger capability of producing noise exposure contours, by the means of computationally deriving Noise-Power-Distance curves for propeller power aircraft. Preliminary NPD curves for General Aviation sized propeller power aircraft are generated and discussed. INTER-NOISE 2021 .All right reserved.;1
10.2514/6.2021-2173;2021;M.+W.+Bauer;Statistical Assessment Of The Influence From Uncertainties In Acoustical Data For Uam Vehicles On Noise Metrics;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) may rapidly change the future of individual air transportation in the years to come. Air-taxis equipped with electric propulsion are thought to bring relief to bigger cities which are suffering from congestion and pollution by emissions, but UAM systems will be still connected to novel air traffic noise. After having established several scenarios dealing with UAM vehicles and describing the acoustic characteristics of a variety of potential air-taxi concepts, a broader study on UAM traffic management has been performed by the author. Because of the large number of different air taxi concepts and their multiple operational conditions, each with its own sound characteristics, a deeper knowledge of future air-taxis noise emissions will be crucial for the understanding of situations around vertiports and air-taxi routes. This includes the question, how uncertainties in the vehicles properties of sound emission, such as power spectrum and directivity, are going to influence noise metrics which are describing community noise and noise impact on the ground. One approach to answer this question is given by the study described here: four different air-taxi systems, provided with generic acoustic properties, were investigated by extensive flyover simulations and statistical assessments in the presence of artificial variations of their acoustic emission data. The results for different noise metrics and their sensitivities regarding these variations were discussed, first conclusions were drawn. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Given relevant UAM aircraft performance models, mission profiles, and Noise-Power-Distance data, AIRNOISEUAM predicts the noise exposure footprint for receptors on the ground. The performance of AIRNOISEUAM using a Robinson R66 helicopter model and a six-passenger quadrotor model, and a diverse set of scenarios from NASA's UAM human-in-the-loop simulations is compared to that of the industry-standard tool with the same inputs. The predicted noise exposure results from both tools are found to be nearly identical.

10.1109/DASC52595.2021.9594290;2021;F.+Morscheck;A Modular Experimental Flight Management And 4D Trajectory Generation System For Unmanned Multicopter, Urban Air Mobility Vehicles And Other Vtol Vehicles;This paper describes a modular flight management system for unmanned multicopters, small unmanned fixed wing vehicles, vehicles used in Urban Air Mobility concepts, helicopters and other VTOL vehicles. With the expected growth in traffic of these types of vehicles especially in the urban environment it is necessary to generate reliable precalculated 4D trajectories for these vehicles. Furthermore, some of these vehicles need additional guidance to keep them on the precalculated path.The second central use case for this system is the fast trajectory calculation for fast and real time traffic simulations with a broad variety of vehicles, especially vehicles which are not covered by conventional flight management and trajectory generation systems.To solve these requirements, the system precalculates precise 4D trajectories for classic and experimental mission designs. These trajectories are tested for safety and continuity by a separate module and could then be executed on the corresponding vehicle (or a simulation) with the use of a guidance module.To calculate this huge variety of vehicles with different means of propulsion, the vehicle performance is kept in a separate module. This allows the system to not only work with different vehicle types, but also to switch between different vehicle configurations with considerable changes in the vehicle's performance and behavior.Some of the targeted vehicles only exist in an earlier design stage or do not provide details performance information. Thus, the performance module is able to work with very simple performance modules based on early design conditions as well as detailed performance models based on exhaustive knowledge of the vehicle's physical behavior.As the flight behaviors could change between the vehicles and their corresponding performance types, not all vehicles could use the same flight phases. Different parts of the trajectory are designed by different modules which specialize in the design of a specific flight phase. The performance module holds the information which flight phase could be applied on the vehicle and the corresponding boundaries. The system includes conventional flight phase modules for takeoff, cruise and landing and the transition between these phases as well as some specific flight phases, such as following waypoints relative to a moving target.The central trajectory management module then coordinates the different flight phases and ensures a continuous trajectory. This module also adds flight phases where required to guaranty a smooth transition between the different phases.Finally, this paper will show some example implementation of this system into traffic simulations and vehicle simulations. 2021 IEEE.;1

This paper describes the efforts made towards the integration of two such services in a simulation environment under ideal conditions and the subsequent studies done on evaluation of system performance. The scheduling and separation services are set up to complement each other to ensure safe separation between airborne aircraft. The utility of these services will become important as the level of traffic increases. This paper describes the simulation experiments conducted to identify cases where the system performance measured by the number of observed losses of separation degrades even with the scheduling and separation services active. From the results obtained, we identify conditions under which the required maneuvers increase and when we observe airborne conflicts even with separation service active. Results obtained will inform requirements for future advancements both in these services independently and in their joint operations. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.1515/noise-2021-0022;2021;F.+Centracchio L.+Burghignoli U.+Iemma;Multiobjective Optimisation Of Flight Paths For Noise Level Mitigation And Sound Quality Improvement;The present work deals with the multiobjective, multidisciplinary optimisation of takeoff and approach operations of a commercial aircraft aimed at the mitigation of the impact of aviation noise on the population. The innovative approach used here couples the minimisation of the aircraft noise level at the certification points with the improvement of the sound quality. The latter objective represents the main novelty of the present work and is addressed using a spectral-matching approach to make the aircraft noise as close as possible to a target sound. The rationale underlying the research is the development of a community-oriented approach to the assessment airport operations in view of the complete redefinition of the future airport scenarios. Indeed, the air traffic growth, the rapid expansion of urban areas around airports, and the expected advent of urban air mobility, are transforming the aviation noise into a serious hazard to the sustainable development of society. The sound-quality-based objective imposes a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach also in the procedural optimisation, due to the detail required to estimate the noise spectrum composition. Two merit factors are minimised, specifically the EPNL at the noise certification points and the Lp-norm of the difference between the noise produced by the configuration under analysis and a target sound. The target sounds are obtained by using sound engineering techniques aimed at the sound quality improvement, on the basis of the results of the psychometric tests campaigns performed within the projects SEFA and COSMA. The minimisation is achieved adopting a global evolution method, and the results are presented in terms of approximated Pareto frontiers for a single-aisle aircraft in both takeoff and landing conditions. 2021 Francesco Centracchio et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.;1
10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.06.019;2021;Q.+Quan M.+Li R.+Fu;Sky Highway Design For Dense Traffic;The number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) continues to explode. Within the total spectrum of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations, Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is also on the way. Dense air traffic is getting ever closer to us. Current research either focuses on traffic network design and route design for safety purpose or swarm control in open airspace to contain large volume of UAVs. In order to achieve a tradeoff between safety and volumes of UAVs, a sky highway with its basic operation for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV is proposed, where traffic network, route and swarm control design are all considered. In the sky highway, each UAV will have its route, and an airway like a highway road can allow many UAVs to perform free flight simutaneously. The geometrical structure of the proposed sky highway with corresponding flight modes to support dense traffic is studied briefly one by one. The effectiveness of the proposed sky highway is shown by the given demonstration. 2021 The Authors.;1
N/A;2021;M.+W.+Scott;Military Mission Suitability Assessment Of Evtol Aircraft Configurations;The U.S. Army Concept Design and Assessment (CD&A) Technology Area has been following leading companies' eVTOL development. Based on the Tech Area's extensive aircraft design and analysis experience questions arose regarding current eVTOLs designs meeting potential military performance and attributes requirements. Similar concerns were seen for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) applications. This document summarizes performance and attribute analyses of leading UAM configurations and compares to helicopters as an alternative configuration. The overall conclusion is that multirotor configurations' speed and range are inherently inadequate for military applications. High Speed eVTOL (HS-eVTOL) configurations (i.e. winged VTOLs) are point designs for high speed, medium range, and very short hover duration missions. They are also inadequate for an important spectrum of military missions. The work concludes the Department of Defense (DoD) needs to invest in more traditional low disk loading eVTOL configurations if it is to gain the most operational benefit from electric propulsion VTOL aircraft.

N/A;2021;L.+F.+Gomez F.+Brenner Z.+Huang;Integrated Multi-Physics Simulation For Evtol In-Flight Energy Regeneration Using Piezoaeroelastic Power Harvesters And 6Dof Control;The recent transportation industry trend towards electrification has created new challenges for urban air mobility technologies. These challenges stem from new vehicle architectures and their increasing complex subsystem interactions, stricter performance demand of powerplants, governing control strategies which aim to optimize energy management and new dynamic problems due to weight reduction. Additionally, Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle manufacturers are attempting to reduce hardware testing in order to have a better understanding of the new governing physics and to rapidly bring these new technologies to production while minimizing costs. Thus, to meet the above-mentioned challenges up front in the development process of electrified vehicles while balancing competing design objectives of dynamic stability, performance and energy efficiency, a simulation-led design and optimization is required to guarantee the best tradeoff. Today, using integrated multi-physics platforms can be instrumental in modeling and analyzing different systems interactions efficiently. By making use of GT-SUITE and OpenVOGEL, this work showcases the development of an eVTOL environment, integrating flight controls, electrical propulsion and unsteady aerodynamic subsonic calculations of lifting surfaces in order to maximize aircraft performance while monitoring the adequate rotor power delivery for aircraft stability. Additionally, an electromechanically-coupled circuit is combined with a piezoaeroelastic model of the wing to harvest energy from the vibration of structure caused by airflow excitations.

N/A;2021;A.+Amer F.+Kopsaftopoulos;On Leveraging Network-Wide Information From Hotspot Sensor Networks Using Multi-Output Gaussian Process Regression Models;With the needs for full structural state awareness and health monitoring as well as emerging challenges of Urban Air Mobility (UAV) and Future Vertical Lift (FVL), Health and Usage Monitoring systems (HUMS) need to be more accurate, robust and reliable than ever before. In active-sensing guided-wave networks in particular, conventional Damage Index (DI)-based approaches have been the industry standard for decades because of their computational simplicity and ability to do the damage detection and quantification tasks. However, under specific circumstances, like for specific actuator-sensor paths within a network or due to varying operational conditions, DIs can suffer from various drawbacks that make them prone to inaccurate and/or ineffective damage quantification. This study builds on previous work by the authors where DIs were used to train single-output Gaussian Process regression models (SOGPRMs) for robust damage quantification, and the accuracy limit of SOGPRMs was shown to depend on the evolution of the chosen DI formulation with damage size. In this study, multi-output GPRMs (MOGPRMs) are used instead in order to leverage information about damage size from multiple actuator-sensor path DI values. It is shown that the proposed approach can overcome the different shortcomings of DI evolution with damage size in the different path by capturing the correlation between the DI evolution for different paths. The proposed framework is applied for an Al coupon with simulated damage, and the damage size quantification results are compared with those of SOGPRMs. It is shown that the information fusion approach exhibited by MOGPRMs gives more accurate damage size estimations compared to SOGPRMs. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

As a first step to assess the feasibility of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) in urban areas, we conduct regionalization and correspondence analysis in highly urbanized areas - San Francisco, CA and Manhattan, NY - by incorporating population dataset and urban 3D airspace to delineate the regional boundaries. Regionalization is carried out using graph-based clustering technique called SKATER (Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal) to group the regions having similar characteristics and address the compound effect of both population and spatial information. By classifying the regions into five categories through correspondence analysis, the operational and economic feasibility of each region is evaluated. The results provide the region maps of each city with the most and least attractive regions for UAM application with the temporal notion, whether the clusters are daytime-intensive or nighttime-intensive areas. Our approach can contribute to providing a useful basis for management for UAM in urban areas as well as the process of regulating airspace use. 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This work presents a control scheme in the horizontal plane that allows a pilot to command ground-based velocities with respect to the vehicle heading and inherently coordinates the turn whenever a change of heading is commanded. The turn coordination algorithm is adapted based on the flight state of the vehicle in order to compensate for the varying influence of wind. It is shown that the adaption improves the control performance during turning flight. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All Rights Reserved.;1

First, noisy and bias corrupted IMU readings are processed as soon as they arrive using kinematic equations represented in the vehicles body frame. To correct the systems drift resulting from the integration, an information content measure is introduced to decide on the environment. For the cluttered environment the information provided by environmental sensors is counted as reliable and the drift correction as accurate. For the open space, the GPS data is counted as reliable, and the drift correction is done based on the GPS readings. The measurement noise effects are minimize using Iterated Extended Kalman Filter framework. The algorithm is implemented in the in-house developed FlightDeckz simulation environment using an IMU model, simulated video recorded from a camera mounted on the vehicle (for the purpose of this study, outside scenery was generated with XPlane), which flies in an urban environment, and GPS data generated from the environments digital map. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2021;K.+Freeman S.+W.+Garcia Jr.+Jr.;Cyber Threats And Security Controls Analysis For Urban Air Mobility Environments;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has become a focus for the next generation of aerial passenger transportation. One of the main focus areas of UAM traffic management is cybersecurity. The Secure Airspace Technology Group (SATG) will analyze current cyber threats and security controls associated with UAM environments. Since the cyber threat landscape changes daily, cybersecurity awareness and cyber threat mitigation must be systemic to the emerging UAM environments and a continuous presence in all its stakeholders and participants. In order to realize the potential of UAM, an assurance of cybersecurity is critical for public acceptance. This paper discusses the approach that SATG took to identifying cyber threats and controls associated with the presently envisioned UAM environment. SATG used information from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research and Engineering (MITRE) Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) model for the identification of cyber threats. The SATG leveraged guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in order to ascertain safeguards and countermeasures for identified cyber threats. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A modeling method for spatial wake interaction of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft is presented. The method validates an existing wake vortex model with flight data from the existing literature. The model is then adopted for both fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. A lift circulation model is developed for rotorcraft to account for unsteady aerodynamics and the compressibility effect. This lift circulation model provides more realistic estimate of lift circulation for rotorcraft for used in wake vortex modeling. A vehicle-building wake interaction is studied using the method of image. The effects of wake vortex encounters on aerodynamic loads, stability, and control are examined. A flight control simulation is performed to demonstrate recovery during a simulated wake vortex encounter. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;1

Often the details of these aspects of design are relegated to later in the design cycle and require significant effort to produce accurate results. While empirical formulations exist for many classes of aircraft, they are not accurate for novel concepts. With the great interest in urban air mobility, eVTOL, and other concepts, a new tool has been developed to aid in structural weight estimation in early design. M4 Structures Studio (M4SS), a tool to parametrically define the structural configuration for aircraft and quickly estimate structural weight, has been enhanced to support the modeling of rotorcraft structures.

10.2514/6.2021-1633;2021;C.+W.+Wai K.+Tan K.+H.+Low;Preliminary Study Of Transport Pattern And Demand In Singapore For Future Urban Air Mobility;This paper aims to present the preliminary feasibility study of future urban air mobility (UAM), by means of flying taxis, based on the existing transportationdemands in Singapore. Some cities such as Dallas, Los Angeles and Melbourne have already investigated the trends of urban air mobility and planned to launch its eVTOL in 2023. The consideration behind flying taxis in Singapore serves to smoothen traffic congestions in the central and industrial areas due to occasional traffic jams caused by road works or accidents, providing greater transportation convenience in a cosmopolitan city. Firstly, the research focused on the demand in terms of cost, travel time and the travel distance for various modes of conventional transport across Singapore. Eight reference mission scenarios were analysed in line with real-time traffic and fare-time patterns were studied to understand how passengers could benefit from it, in terms of time and cost savings. Secondly, the research was narrowed down to the Central Business District (CBD) and focused on tourists transport demands using statistics provided by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). The goal is to determine which districts had the most in-demand and how tourists could benefit by taking a flying taxi. The objective of this preliminary study is also to gather baseline data so as to further investigate on whether flying taxis in Singapore is viable and determine how to optimise that from different perspectives of various stakeholders, including the efficiency of flying taxis. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2021-1628;2021;J.+M.+Zapico W.+A.+Crossley D.+Sun;Assessing Potential Urban Air Mobility Traffic Density In A Metropolitan Area Like Chicago;Driving in metropolitan areas means hours of traffic jams, which results in a reduction of productivity for both the city and peoples lives. Therefore, urban air mobility/air taxis are proposed as a solution to this overwhelming problem. As a consequence, this study is focused on determining the number of feasible trips that could fly over an urban area (in this study, the City of Chicago) considering passenger costs for the air taxi trip using short-, medium-, and long-term operating cost models suggested by Uber. To estimate the number of trips, the study starts with historical data recording the number of commutes in the city together with the origin and destination coordinates for these commute trips. The distribution of these commutes over one day estimates the number of trips at a given hour of the day. The Open Trip Planner API calculates the duration of these commutes, which allows calculation of the effective cost of the trip when using an air taxi for part of the trip. The computational model for this study compares the effective cost of a trip using the air taxi, for part of all the trip, to the effective costs of using only ground-based public transit or a passenger-owned automobile for the same trip. Trips where effective cost is lowest when using air taxi provide a count of the number of UAM trips conducted over the city. Following this initial estimate of the urban airspace density, the model can subsequently assess the impact of additional considerations about restricted areas of the city (in Chicago, the class B airspace for Midway Airport, is one example). Thereby, a first approach of feasible routes is implemented using an optimization path algorithm. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;1
N/A;2021;D.+Barazanchy J.+Pandher M.+Tooren;The Edge-Effect In Induction Welding Of Thermoplastic Composites;A shift in material and manufacturing methodology is needed to cope with the increasing demand for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Cargo Air Vehicles (CAVs), which require both light-weight structures capable of handling aerospace-loading conditions, and a high rate production throughput. To address these requirements, thermoplastic composites are explored to utilize their weight, mechanical, toughness and durability properties to comply with structural requirements. In addition, thermoplastic composites open the possibility to fastener-free assembly technologies, such as induction welding, allowing composite structures to be assembled through local melting and re-solidifying, without the need for mechanical fasteners or adhesives. However, during the induction welding process undesired localized hot-spots can occur near the edges of a part, resulting in subpar quality of the joint and an unwanted surface finish (thermal based delamination). To better understand how the hot-spots occur, a detailed investigation by analyzing the current flow through the thermoplastic composite laminate layers is performed. The analysis was done using an in-house development mixed boundary element (BE) / finite element (FE) software code, WelDone. For a laminated thermoplastic composite, it is shown that the current flow is influenced by the electromagnetic (EM) field generated by the induction coil. The induction coil shape dictates the current flow in a specified direction, and together with the material architecture and anisotropic conductivity of the thermoplastic composite, a build-up of current near an edge can occur, matching in experimentally observed hot-spots during the induction welding process. At last, the current build-up at edges in a metal is investigated as well, and the differences between a metallic monolithic plate and a composite laminate are discussed. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

An Urban Air Mobility Case Study;Advancement in artificial intelligence, internet of things and information technology have enabled the delegation of execution of autonomous services to autonomous systems for civil applications. It is envisioned, that with an increase in the demand for autonomous systems, the decision making associated in the execution of the autonomous services will be distributed, with some of the responsibility in decision making, shifted to the autonomous systems. Thus, it is of utmost importance that we assure the correctness of distributed protocols, that multiple autonomous systems will follow, as they interact with each other in providing the service. Towards this end, we discuss our proposed framework to model, analyze and assure the correctness of distributed protocols executed by autonomous systems to provide a service. We demonstrate our approach by formally modeling the behavior of autonomous systems that will be involved in providing services in the Urban Air Mobility framework that enables air taxis to transport passengers. 2020 Science and Information Organization.

10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256593;2020;J.+Dunham E.+Johnson E.+Feron B.+German;Unmanned Systems Health Analysis Through Evidential Reasoning Networks;Evidential reasoning, developed by Glenn Shafer and Arthur Dempster in the 1960s and 1970s, has been extensively applied to risk analysis, sensor fusion, and system failure analysis. Use in real-time systems for health analysis has been more limited due to computational complexity requiring less either comprehensive analysis or significant computing power. Evidential reasoning networks, also known as valuation networks, reduce computational requirements by eliminating hypothesis combinations which are infeasible. Recent extensions enable these networks to learn the relationships between nodes based on evidence inputs, enabling these networks to adapt without the need of subject matter experts defining each relationship update. This system is applied to unmanned system health analysis, demonstrating the capability to run complex belief analyses in real-time on autopilot systems with low computational power using the GUST autopilot system developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Comparisons are made between the evidential combination approach and more traditional contingency management that uses time delays and worst-case scenario assumptions for contingency responses. Simulation training is used as a surrogate for high volumes of flight testing, and operational results are primarily tested through GUST simulation of a representative mission. Results show that evidential reasoning networks are an effective approach to real-time health analysis of unmanned systems, using the novel update rules to understand relationships based on operational outcomes. Flight demonstration is included to show the capability to run this system in real operations. This work has implications on integration of unmanned systems into the national airspace as well as on Urban Air Mobility. Results from the network are explainable, enabling human oversight of operational decisions. Real-time implementation enables integration into avionics systems. Further, the data-driven approach to learning relationships enables this system to adapt as information concerning unmanned systems steadily changes. 2020 IEEE.;1

Rather than centralised airspace management (which is rapidly reaching capacity limits), those vehicles need to collaborate safely and efficiently. However, the vehicles differ significantly with respect to capabilities, carried equipment, and certification requirements. The main focus of this paper is how to determine a safe level of interaction in a heterogeneous network, where not all vehicles are (equally) trustworthy, but cooperation is required for many different reasons (e.g., collision avoidance, implementation of collaborative tasks). Consequently, this paper presents the main research challenges deriving from integrating UASs in a shared airspace, with a focus on the demanding scenario of urban air mobility. Specific use cases are described to highlight the main challenges and requirements for a security architecture. Furthermore, a roadmap is presented towards addressing the main challenges: trust estimation, interaction adaptation, controlled information sharing, and continuous monitoring and adaptation. 2020 IEEE.;1

Region servicing private jet owners and first-class passengers from local airports to and from central business districts, assuming relaxed aerial vehicle and FAA restrictions. A stochastic simulation with random variables for vehicle speed, boarding times, vertiport operation times, and passenger inter-arrival times identified the need for a 5 node network with 70 vehicles, 3 landing pads, and 2 UAM vehicle parking space at the business Vertiports, servicing 369 flights per day. A Return on Investment of 122% can be achieved with a break-even in 2 years on an investment of 160M. 2020 IEEE.;1
10.1109/ICNS50378.2020.9223002;2020;S.+Tuchen;Multimodal Transportation Operational Scenario And Conceptual Data Model For Integration With Uam;With new aviation market entrants such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles, the role aviation will take in seamless, end-to-end multimodal transportation is evolving. Travelers will likely be able to request on-demand, point-to-point transportation through air taxis in the not-to-distant future. Previous multimodal research efforts have focused on surface urban mobility, where multiple modes of ground transportation compete with and complement each other, ignoring the growing role that aviation will play going forward. Existing public transportation data exchange models, tailored for their respective systems, likewise, have not yet accounted for this looming transportation transformation nor for widespread multimodal end-to-end, seamless transporting. To date, the FAA has succeeded in establishing a robust data exchange architecture to support traditional air transportation, but to facilitate this evolution of the public airspace system with respect to UAM and other emerging air vehicle systems, new and revised data exchange models are necessary. Existing data exchange models in need of revision include the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) and the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) [2], [3]. New data exchange models in need of creation include the Passenger Information Exchange Model (PIXM), the Operation Information Exchange Model (OIXM), and Vehicle Information Exchange Model (VIXM) [1]. The research here explored these data models, identifying and defining preliminary conceptual data elements necessary to support seamless, end-to-end mobility. The conceptual model herein proposed is holistic and considers all modes of transportation - walk, car, bus, rail, boat, air, etc. - and looks to incorporate the most promising transportation data exchange models from among these transportation systems.A realistic multimodal travel scenario subject to disruptive events (such as severe weather) was developed for the purpose of identifying the necessary exchange of data to reduce the impact of the disruptive events on the traveler. This work helped inform the next steps in the project, the definition of multimodal data exchange models and the development of a corresponding multimodal transportation conceptual data model. The scenario includes Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles that are intended to serve as short haul providers operating in a congested urban metro environment to bypass surface traffic congestion. New aviation market entrants, such as UAM, will likely not operate entirely within a traditional gate to gate model and are eventually likely to use a model similar to on-demand surface transportation such as ride share. Uber Elevate has already been proposing this type of application for their future air taxis [4]. Accommodating these new aviation market entrants will require further extensions to the FIXM (a second package for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) is already planned by the FIXM committee), adoption and enhancement of existing industry data exchange models, and entirely new data models. GTFS is the industry-leading and international de facto public transportation data exchange standard and has an extension called flex for supporting on-demand mobility, though has been limited to surface applications thus far [3], [5]. Alongside FIXM and GTFS, new models are necessary to facilitate seamless, end-to-end mobility. Proposed models include the Vehicle Information Exchange Model (VIXM), the Passenger Information Exchange Model (PIXM), and the Operator Information Exchange Model (OIXM) [1].This paper serves as an initial exploration of a data exchange model for future of transportation. The authors envision a future where a traveler can easily plan, dynamically re-plan, and track the real-time progress of a multimodal trip from the convenience of a smartphone application. The authors include a description of a future smartphone application to help illustrate the concept (Section 5). Section 6 provides a brief history of multimodal data exchange initiatives. Section 7 includes a brief discussion of next steps and recommendations for continued research. 2020 IEEE.;1

To ensure real-time performance, the MCTS algorithm is limited in search depth, thus easy to fall into the local optimal solution, resulting in the inability to achieve collision avoidance and track optimization in the scene with static obstacles. Therefore, a discrete path point combining the advantages of Jump Point Search algorithm in global planning is established to guide UAVs, and the reward function is improved to balance the flight path, avoiding local dynamic collisions and static obstacles simultaneously. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm can achieve better performance in different experimental scenarios, particularly in the simulation model of concave restricted flight area, where, compared with the original MCTS algorithm, the collision probability of the improved algorithm and the flight time are reduced by 36% and 47.8%, respectively. 2020, Press of Chinese Journal of Aeronautics.

N/A;2020;M.+Bauer;Assessment Of En-Route Noise By Simulated Scenarios For Future Urban Air Traffic;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a rapidly developing branch of future air transport, where novel electrically driven air taxis will be operated close to larger cities. Beside the fact that growing individual road traffic already brings urban infrastructure to its limits, future UAM is recognized as a potential efficient contribution to traffic related carbon-dioxide reduction. But, using pure electric engines, which are regarded to be less noisy than combustion machines, all currently discussed propulsion concepts will generate aerodynamic noise from rotors, propellers or fans. In a previous study, covering an area of about 9,500 km2 and operating two different generic air taxi systems, the author has shown that - depending on their propulsion concepts - additional aviation noise will be created, not only close to air taxi ports but also en-route in regions where currently no aircraft noise is relevant. This new work presents additional investigations, which are taking into account more realistic aspects, such as varying flight levels and multiple vehicle velocities.

The method employs weak-signal correlation techniques and long measurement intervals to achieve a 1 km range. Low-cost radar is an enabling technology for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft envisioned for large-scale deployment in urban areas. These aircraft must be autonomously piloted to make them economically feasible, but autonomous systems have yet to match a human pilot's ability to detect and avoid (DAA) obstacles. Visible light cameras are useful for this application, but cameras alone are insufficient, as they are fundamentally unable to resolve range. Existing commercial radar units would suffice for DAA, but their large size weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) militates against their application to UAM. The technique detailed in this paper is a fused camera-radar solution that exploits the camera's excellent angular resolution to guide radar signal processing so that signals arriving from a camera-detected target are combined constructively. Such guided processing significantly extends the range of low SWaP-C radar chipsets, making them useful for DAA. An analysis of the fused technique's robustness to target velocity uncertainty is presented, along with experimental results indicating that a typically-sized VTOL aircraft would be detectable at a range of 1 km. 2020 IEEE.;1

For example, near earth relays are looking to transition from the traditional few large geostationary satellites to satellite constellations consisting of thousands of small low earth orbiting satellites while lunar space communications will require the need to relay data from many assets distributed on the lunar surface back to earth. Furthermore, within the aeronautics realm, satellite communications for beyond line of sight (BLOS) links are being investigated in tandem with the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) within the urban air mobility (UAM) environment. In all of these scenarios, future communications architectures will demand the need to connect and quickly transition between many nodes for large data volume transport. As such, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has been heavily investigating the development of low cost phased array technologies that can readily address these various scenario conditions. In particular, GRC is presently exploring 5G-based beamformer technologies to leverage commercial timescale and volume production cycles which have heretofore not existed within the frequency allocations utilized for NASA applications. In this paper, an overview of the potential future applications of phased arrays being envisioned by NASA are discussed, along with technology feasibility demonstrations being conducted by GRC implementing low cost, 5G based beamformer technologies. 2020 EurAAP.;1

Presently, in North America, the population in urban areas is already estimated at 82% (United Nations, 2019). As the size of the urban population grows, the urban environment will be increasingly tasked to sustain the activities of a larger portion of the worlds population. The urban boundary layer (UBL), the portion of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) whose climatic characteristics are modified by the presence of a city (Oke, 1976), is this environment. However, the UBL is one of the most complex and least understood microclimates due to the heterogeneity of the fabric underlying it and roughness elements composing it, omnipresent turbulence and anthropogenic heat sources, among other complex processes. 2020.

N/A;2020;K.+Al A.+Saleem R.+F.+Abdelal D.+Heckmann M.+Fischer A.+Nase;The Integral Approach To Define The Ecosystem For The Aerial Taxi Service In Dubai;While helicopter-based Aerial Taxi Services (ATS) are nothing new, Urban Air Mobility gains traction with the vast amount of new eVTOL concepts announced in the recent past. Dubai has the strategy to make the ATS an integral part of a multimodal mobility with the aspiration to not limit the service to the financially affluent. By conducting an integral approach to define the entire ecosystem and requirements to setup the Aerial Taxi Service, the authors found out that an implementation of a financially viable eVTOL based ATS needs more than just the exchange of legacy helicopters. From the use-case definition across requirements for a dedicated eVTOL infrastructure (vertistructure) and the aircraft's integration into the airspace, the aircraft is situated within a series of interacting trade-offs. Only by identifying and solving bottlenecks in the overall operation a promising ATS concept can be defined. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;1
N/A;2020;C.+A.+Snyder;More / All Electric Vertical Take-Off And Landing (Vtol) Vehicle Sensitivities To Propulsion And Power Performance;Battery power and energy density are important parameters for emerging concepts for more / all-electric vehicles. Electric propulsion and power system performance is also important. To better understand how electric propulsion and power systems component performance influences overall vehicle design, a sensitivity assessment was performed noting changes in vehicle gross weight and energy usage. Updated versions of the Revolutionary Vertical lift Technology (RVLT) Project vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) urban air mobility (UAM) reference vehicles and missions were used. NASA electric vehicle studies are discussed which were used to help select the range of electric propulsion and power system performance parameters used in this assessment. Thermal management systems (TMS) considerations are also important, new and innovative power management and distribution (PMAD) systems can reduce electric system weight and losses, reducing thermal management constraints often imposed by electric systems modest maximum use temperatures. Vehicles with higher disk loadings require higher power levels per unit weight for VTOL operations, which make them more sensitive to electric system weights and efficiencies. Battery, all-electric vehicles show different sensitivities to component performance than turboelectric or hybrids systems. Battery, all-electric propulsion systems may increase vehicle weight and size, but still results in lower mission energy usage than their hydrocarbon-fueled versions. Significant vehicle weight growth to electric propulsion and power system power-to-weight reductions also occurs at different levels among the various concepts. From these results, one can more readily identify required component performance levels, potential component choices, or research and development paths. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;1

10.2514/6.2020-2904;2020;H.+K.+Ng;Strategic Planning With Unscented Optimal Guidance For Urban Air Mobility;This study proposes a strategic trajectory planning framework to support development of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) traffic networks and optimization of UAM aircraft trajectories that are robust to uncertain wind fields. The development of UAM traffic networks considers static aviation constraints and dynamic weather constraints in urban airspace and the connections to ground transportation networks for preliminary selection of feasible time-optimal routes. The trajectory optimization of UAM aircraft utilizes an unscented optimal guidance approach to generate cost-optimal trajectories constrained on the selected sigma values of probability distribution of uncertain wind fields while ensuring that the end-point constraints are met for reducing wind-induced trajectory uncertainty. Unscented guidance commands are assessed based on trajectory perturbations at subsequent end-points in various wind fields by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. An example of wind-optimal UAM corridor and the associated trajectory-based operation volume is created utilizing the perturbations of the unscented trajectories for preliminary assessment of required aircraft separation minima without knowledge of aircraft navigation performance. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Early adoption of urban air mobility (UAM) using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft could be shuttle-like service between downtown and airports, given that timely arrival to airports are more critical than many other purposes of roadway trips. Such UAM operations require that vertiports are located on or near airports. VTOLs routes arriving at and departing from vertiports will need to carefully designed to support the sharing of terminal airspace without causing any safety concerns. Using a combination of geographical information system tools and trajectory planning algorithms, this research seeks to evaluate the feasibility of Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) trajectories in the airport area and examine potential vertiport locations within or near the terminal environment. Present operations at one major airport were modeled to create a baseline of current manned operations. A Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm was employed to design minimum cost VTOL trajectories that stay a specified distance from current manned operations, terrain features, and obstacles. The research examined the challenges and constraints associated with VTOL routes arriving and departing from several likely vertiport locations and suggested future methods to stay clear of current manned aircraft trajectories. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2020-3251;2020;V.+Stouffer P.+F.+Kostiuk;Cameos: Uam Flight Planning, Deconfliction, And Monitoring Tool;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) development has launched, to the point of operators beginning helicopter air taxi service in dense urban environments, under Part 135 Air Taxi service. This humble beginning is like the DVDs-by-mail launch for a future Netflix type industry transformation. On the way to on demand electric mobility, the UAM industry has to grow and evolve its UAM services, including dispatch and flight monitoring services. The City-wide Air Mobility Evaluation and Operations System (CAMEOS) was created to allow an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operational dispatcher to plan and rehearse a flight virtually and check for issues before filing a flight plan. CAMEOS was designed to serve a UAM operator offering air taxi services using a fleet of vehicles that take-off and descend vertically and fly according to a flight plan within a defined urban environment with urban and near-urban destinations. Given that the urban climate is largely unknown and there is a lack of detailed, real-time, widespread, accurate forecasts, particular attention will need to be paid to battery levels during flight, and from flight to flight, by the flight dispatcher. The dispatcher will not plan a flight that is likely to enter a state of insufficient battery. CAMEOS checks the flight plan against the available battery to ensure the flight can be completed successfully. The dispatcher can create and visualize flight plans in CAMEOS, rehearse the flight plan, and then send the flight plan to the vehicle using CAMEOS connections to the flight deck. Once underway, the dispatcher can monitor the flight, as well as all other flights in the fleet, in the CAMEOS terminal window. In order to design this flight planning, flight deconfliction, and flight monitoring service, we had to assume a network of vertiports in a dense US urban area, create flight rules, and design approach paths, and create a notional performance profile for urban air vehicles. This paper describes the CAMEOS tool and the hypothetical urban air environment and performance profiles created to showcase CAMEOS abilities. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2020-3253;2020;Z.+Wu Y.+Zhang;Optimal Evtol Charging And Passenger Serving Scheduling For On-Demand Urban Air Mobility;One of the critical obstacles that restricts the large-scale urban air mobility (UAM) service is limited flight range of electric vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts (eVTOL). Continuous operations as well as on-demand service require frequent recharge of eVTOLs within a limited time. On the one hand, it puts high requirements on battery energy storage and facility charging rate. On the other hand, a well-designed scheduling strategy should be implemented to satisfy the recharging needs of eVTOL while satisfying the service demand from UAM users. In our research, a mixed integer program is developed to model the eVTOL charging scheduling process with the objective to minimize the total waiting time of passengers. The proposed model is able to solve the charging and passenger serving scheduling problem in a reasonable short time, making it feasible for realtime operations of UAM service. Meanwhile, the result analyses provide implications regarding the relations among the number of charging facilities, computation efficiency and the service quality. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In addition, the focus has been placed on developing autonomous vehicles for intra-city short haul flights using vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft in effort to facilitate NASAs new Urban Air Mobility (UAM) program. This requires precise knowledge of the current health state of the entire vehicle, and the ability to estimate and predict the state of health over time to make these short missions robust and safe. Online estimation methodologies that reason about faults and component degradation are critical to the safety of the aircraft, its occupants, and the success of its mission. More importantly, it is necessary to understand how degradation at the component level affect the performance of the overall system. We hypothesize that utilizing a holistic approach to system health management will result in a robust framework which can be applied to a number of safety-critical systems. We study the effects of multiple degrading components in the powertrain system of the DJI Mavic Pro quad-copter on the entire system and provide a framework for system-level prognostics under multiple sources of degradation and uncertainty. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, before any of these vehicles see commercial flight they must be certified by the civil aviation authorities. The Federal Aviation Administration in the United States and the European Aviation Safety Agency in Europe are currently in the process of developing appropriate certification procedures. Instead of only focusing on creating new certification requirements, both agencies are currently looking into the option of adjusting present certifications for light aircraft. In particular, the FAA considers adjusting the Part 23 airworthiness standards with special conditions to allow for certification of eVTOL Urban Air Mobility vehicles (UAM). One of the hurdles prohibiting the use of Part 23 for certification of eVTOL vehicles is proper thrust and energy management. It must be ensured at all times that the vehicle has sufficient energy stored in its batteries to perform critical flight maneuvers and that this information is continuously communicated to the pilot or a control system. If the estimate of the power required to maintain a flight state or the energy required to safely complete a maneuver exceeds the available reserves, the pilot must be warned and provided with a suggested plan of actions. In addition, the aviation authorities need tools to verify statements made by the aircraft manufacturers pertaining to achievable flight performance, range and safety margins, in order to assist them in the flight safety assessment and airworthiness certification process. The purpose of the model presented in this paper is to serve as first-principle model capable of calculating power and energy requirements for variety of electric eVTOL vehicle designs operating in user-specified conditions. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Urban Air Mobility is a rapidly growing concept with the promise of alleviating the traffic on the ground by moving parts of urban transportation to the air. One of the challenges of the urban air mobility is addressing of the On-Demand Mobility vehicles. This paper analyzes this challenge and also suggests practical solutions.

Moreover, multiple scenarios of possible policies and flexibilities along with their traffic-flow patterns will be presented. Their impact on the allowed flight time will be discussed.

These challenges include battery technology, increasing levels of automation and autonomy, noise, vehicle certification, and airspace management. In this paper, we explore the potential of a near-term small-scale UAM service that avoids many of these challenges through the use of a currently available general aviation airplane retrofitted with an electric propulsion system. In particular, we investigate the applicability of a battery electric variant of the Cessna 208B Caravan for short-haul intracity commuter trips in U.S. cities. Missions with a range of up to 50 nautical miles at a cruise speed of 150 kts are anticipated to be feasible using current battery technology. Based on the opportunity to reduce passenger commuting time compared to driving, we find that in certain U.S. cities with geographic constraints and high levels of traffic congestion, there is significant potential demand for such a service, even considering the first-and last-mile challenges of trips to and from origin and destination airports. This type of UAM service might be a useful initial step as a minimum viable product to assess the publics willingness to adopt aviation for short ranged daily trips if the price point of the service can be reduced adequately via new technologies such as electric propulsion. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

There are also large numbers of new and upcoming users requesting access to the NAS, including unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and urban air mobility vehicles. This paper describes a modeling and simulation framework and an initial capability to support research and technical analyses on the potential use of the fourth-generation (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless network architecture and its fifth-generation (5G) progression for aviation communications. The research presented in this paper is focused on developing the means to analyze an initial problem, namely how the performance of LTE-based networks, developed for terrestrial use, will be affected by the potential introduction of small UAS (sUAS) as additional users. More and more sUAS are requesting access to the NAS for complex operations beyond the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the remote pilot in command. To safely support such beyond-VLOS (BVLOS) operations, a reliable UAS command and control (C2) solution is necessary. This paper describes initial scenarios, analysis methodologies, and simulation results of using LTE to support a UAS C2 use case. The analyzed scenarios developed for this use case are in a rural environment with small unmanned aircraft (sUA) and terrestrial users sharing the resources of an LTE-based network. 2019 EUROCONTROL.

N/A;2019;O.+Cornes;Basic Design Limitations For Urban Electric Vtol Aircraft;Urban air mobility has the potential to change the face of aeronautics and transporation, which has created a lot of speculation on what the new technology is capable of. The uncertainty is increased by the fact that urban air mobility is a unchartered field of aeronautics and the proposed designs vary significantly, especially because of new technologies such as distributed electric propulsion which give extreme design freedom. However, there exist a short series of simple physical rules that set limits on what can be done in order to meet stringent constraints of urban eVTOLs, such as noise, range, and payload requirements. This work aims at showing these limits, especially with regards to aircraft footprint and noise, and what technological and physical parameters drive these limits. The method employed uses an original but simple mathematical model to size eVTOLs for a variety of missions based on extensive quantities only, such as power required for flight, battery capacity and empty weight fraction. The assembly of these comparatively simple equations reduces down to solving a quartic equation for sizing an aircraft, which is done rapidly and robustly with a current desktop computer, and thus allows for extensive design space exploration. Using this tools, this work investigates the effects of increasing range, payload, and footprint of eVTOL aircraft for urban transportation needs. It is found that the rotor area to footprint ratio should be greater than 0.2 to avoid large mass penalties due to excessive power requirements. Also, smaller footprint vehicle require relatively larger rotors to be feasible. Main drivers for the take-off noise is found to be footprint, whereas improved battery technology has negligible effect on noise. Copyright 2019 by AHS - The Vertical Flight Society.

N/A;2019;D.+Schrage;Setting The Record Straight On Failures And Successes In Army Aviation Development Programs Over The Past Forty-Five Years;Army Aviation Development Programs have had more failures than successes since beginning with the successful Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) and Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) development programs in the early 1970s. While these follow-on failures have often been blamed on either the Army user, Army developer or industry, they often come with biases from sideline participants without firsthand knowledge. The author of this paper has had mostly firsthand involvement and knowledge on these Army Aviation Development Programs over the past 45 years and he will seek to set the record straight. It will start with a review of Army Aviation Air Mobility Doctrine in the 1960s and it development and implementation in Southeast Asia, for which the author directly participated in. The initial implementation in South Vietnam was based on using off the shelf modified aircraft, predominantly helicopters. These lessons learned had a major impact on developing new aircraft and major modifications in the 1970s, e.g. UTTAS, AAH, CH-47D and OH-58D for which the author also directly participated in. There are critical lessons learned from this Air Mobility Doctrine development and the major aircraft programs which resulted from it, which are especially critical as the Army seeks major new development programs over the next decade. Also, it appears that the current focus on Urban Air Mobility (UAM) with the incorporation of new eVTOL aircraft, such as air taxis and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) into a low altitude Traffic Management (UTM) environment, also has a lot to learn from the Armys Air Mobility Doctrine development and the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, e.g. helicopters,, that were developed to implement it.

10.2514/6.2019-1059;2019;A.+Bateman J.+Burkholder T.+Summers N.+Richards;Incorporating Rf Coverage Analysis In Mission Planning For Future Airspace Operations;Unmanned aircraft typically rely on radio frequency (RF) links for at least command and control (C2) and navigation, and may also employ RF links for other critical functions, such as position reporting through ADS-B or mode C transponders. Vehicles used in future On Demand Mobility (ODM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations, whether flown with no onboard operator or with a minimally trained onboard operator, are expected to be similarly dependent on RF links for navigation, control, and communication with Air Traffic Control (ATC) (whether by a human or an automated system). Loss of even one of these links can present a significant hazard. For example, recent UAS accidents have often involved lost communication links. As the level of autonomy of UAS increases, loss of C2 links may not be directly catastrophic though it is still likely to be disruptive to airspace operations, and other RF links, particularly satellite navigation links, become essential for maintaining safe vehicle operations. The challenges of maintaining RF links will grow as operations of highly autonomous vehicles expand, and as envisioned future concepts of operation become a reality. Future aviation systems such as UAS operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) and air taxis operating as part of an envisioned UAM system will frequently operate at low altitudes far from established airports. At these low altitudes, terrain, buildings, and even vegetation can significantly impact RF coverage. This paper presents initial results of a research effort to integrate RF coverage analysis into the mission planning process for UAS and other future vehicles, such as air taxis. The overall research effort is developing tools to analyze coverage of both C2 and navigation links along an intended flight path, as well as automated path generation tools that produce mission plans that minimize the likelihood of RF link loss. This paper focuses on analysis of air-to-ground RF links, and mission planning to minimize the likelihood of loss of such links. Numerical examples focus on Manhattan, using a representative mission of passenger transport from LaGuardia airport to lower Manhattan to demonstrate both RF coverage analysis and path planning. 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2019-0949;2019;P.+Sharma C.+Ochoa E.+Atkins;Sensor-Aware Flight Envelopes For Urban Air Mobility;Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) proposed for use in surveillance, delivery, and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) have increasingly capable onboard sensor suites that aid in mapping and navigating the local environment. This paper investigates the effects of sensor range and noise on UAS performance and translates sensor limitations to new sensor-based constraints in safe flight envelope. We propose an obstacle distance safety metric to constrain the set of safe approach velocities for a small UAS (sUAS) flying in or near an urban canyon. Two case studies defining a sensor-aware flight envelope for fixed wing and multicopter aircraft equipped with onboard LiDAR and GPS are presented to validate this proposed metric. Maximum steady level flight velocity is constrained by both vehicle performance and sensor limitations, resulting in a set of modified flight envelopes that consider both. Our distance metric not only aids in determining the set of safe velocities for the UAS, it also provides a method to determine onboard UAS sensor requirements at design time, i.e., accuracy and range, based on vehicle performance limitations such as stall speed, deceleration profile, and turn radius. 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

N/A;2018;C.+A.+Snyder L.+W.+Kohlman;Using Liquid Natural Gas Fuel To Cryogenically Cool And Enhance A Hybrid Electric Aircraft Power System;A previous system study identified significant increases in range and number of urban air mobility (UAM) missions by replacing the all battery power system of a notional UAM vehicle with an advanced diesel hybrid using conventional diesel or liquid natural gas (LNG) fuels (at constant vehicle design gross weight). Some benefits were realized using the LNG's cryogenic properties to reduce some electrical component losses and cooling requirements. Significant questions were raised concerning volume and thermal management considerations for all studied systems. The notional, baseline vehicle was a hybrid helicopter / airplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), balancing high cruise efficiency with reasonable hover capability. A subsequent power system assessment using the same notional vehicle and mission was performed that identified increased volume and power requirements for the active cooling required. The cooling airflow could also generate additional drag on the vehicle during operation. For the notional vehicle studied, the additional volume identified by the subsequent study would not affect vehicle mold line and therefore drag. However, the additional drag from cooling airflow and the power to circulate it as needed would impact power system and vehicle mission performance. Vehicle and mission models were updated and rerun. Updated results still indicated significant benefits in range and number of UAM missions, but reduced the benefit by 12-15%. Hold time for the hybrid systems also generally increased a few minutes because of reduced power available for charging from the power for required cooling flows. Vehicle weights, thermal loads, and cooling airflows from the updated analyses were similar to previous results. Copyright 2017 by AHS International, Inc. All rights reserved.;1

10.1007/978-981-19-2635-8_9;2023;Y.+Shimizu T.+Tsuchiya;Analysis Of Wingless Evtol Dynamics And Design Low-Level Controller;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a new type flying vehicle that transports people and goods around urban cities. The major electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) concepts being studied and developed currently are 3-types, Vectored Thrust, Lift + Cruise, and Wingless. This paper focuses on the Wingless eVTOL because it has effective performances for short-range flight operation that will take the main role of Japanese UAM. Conventionally, a heavy rotor aircraft such as helicopter uses variable pitch to control thrust quickly, and heavy Wingless eVTOLs are suggested to have variable pitch as well. However, owing to the development of strong electric motors, the Wingless eVTOL like CityAirbus and VoloCity is controllable by variable speed method as well as UAV. The advantage of variable speed is significant regarding simplicity and maintenance cost. We analyzed the Wingless eVTOL detailed dynamics with rotor aerodynamics (blade element theory and momentum theory) and simple electric motor model. We took care of an additional counter torque by rotor inertia. UAV has the same effect, but it is so relatively small to air drag torque that it can be ignored. For the Wingless eVTOL, the angular acceleration of rotor brings large effect to control yaw. In order to overcome rotor inertia, we used many small propellers and the existing latest motor. This paper includes eVTOL dynamics that has unique behaviors and characteristics including both conventional helicopter and UAV. Moreover, our control architecture includes the command filtering, the reference model, the linear feedback and feedforward controller, the incremental dynamics inversion, and the mixer of 8 coaxial rotor with taking the rotor inertia. Finally, we applied the pilot command (attitude command) to the closed-loop system, and checked if hover and low speed requirements for small and moderate attitude change satisfy the ADS-33E. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A
10.1007/978-981-19-2635-8_3;2023;J.+Lee H.+Lee J.+Noh H.+Bang;Traffic Navigation For Urban Air Mobility With Reinforcement Learning;Assuring stability of the guidance law for quadrotor-type Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is important since it is assumed to operate in urban areas. Model free reinforcement learning was intensively applied for this purpose in recent studies. In reinforcement learning, the environment is an important part of training. Usually, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is used widely for reinforcement learning of quadrotors. However, PPO algorithms for quadrotors tend to fail to guarantee the stability of the guidance law in the environment as the search space increases. In this work, we show the improvements of stability in a multi-agent quadrotor-type UAM environment by applying the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. The simulations were performed in Unity. Our results achieved three times better reward in the Urban Air Mobility environment than when trained with the PPO algorithm and our approach also shows faster training time than the PPO algorithm. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A

Digital twin technology (DT) introduces a coupled virtual-physical asset system that evolves over time in their digital and physical state-spaces associated with the real-time exchange of observed data and control inputs for high-fidelity operational services in UAM, such as traffic management, or vehicle maintenance. On the other hand, edge computing has been envisioned as a dominant computing paradigm in future UAM infrastructures to enable infinitesimal-latency processing of massive and heterogeneous data acquired from ubiquitous devices and vehicles. Furthermore, federated learning (FL) has recently been proposed to resolve the performance and security problems of traditional AI techniques featured by centralized data collection and training to offer a decentralized and cooperative data training pattern among a huge number of devices/vehicles (aka., agents) in multi agent DT systems for UAM. Lastly, the blockchain has emerged as a ledger technology in which data and processes are divided into tiny data blocks and concatenated into a series to reinforce the security and scalability of decentralized computing patterns. Realizing the advances and integration of the emerging technologies mentioned above is of paramount importance for the development of DT systems in UAM. Previous studies have not completely considered the integration and harmony of these existing technologies for the development of UAM DT systems. There has also been a significant lack in comprehension and integration of emerging technologies for the development of UAM-DT systems. In that context, this study proposes a comprehensive integrated UAM-DT platform and solution of FL with the blockchain in edge computing for the development of UAM-DT systems, called BlockFE-DT. First, we introduce the adoption of a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical foundation of coupled digital-physical twin systems for UAM, particularly for unmanned aircrafts. Afterwards, we review the fundamental concepts of FL, blockchain, and edge computing technologies to explore and propose an integration framework of FL with the blockchain in edge computing in the context of UAM-DT systems. Key issues in the integration are assimilated including explainable AI, dependability, and security. This work provides ground-breaking concepts and architectures for a blockchain empowered FL framework with edge computing in future UAM-DT systems. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A
10.1007/978-981-19-2635-8_39;2023;D.+Seon S.+Jeong;Terrain-Driven Wind Environment Generation For Uam;Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has been attracting a lot of attention as a possible solution to solve traffic congestion in metropolitan city areas. However, there are still several problems of UAM operation to be solved. One of the most important issues is safe flight under bad weather conditions. Especially, safe operation of the UAM under strong winds and turbulence is a critical problem. To address this issue, the flight characteristics of the UAM should be evaluated under an actual urban wind environment. In this study, a method of generating realistic urban wind environments is suggested. The weather research and forecasting (WRF)large eddy simulation (LES) coupled model with the iterative nesting algorithm was adopted to generate a wind environment with sufficient resolution for UAM. To validate the WRF accuracy, the result was compared with observation data. The LES results were also analyzed in terms of the characteristics of the wind pattern around the building. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A

Prior researchers have utilized several drones in collaboration to navigate to achieve common goals such as target tracking, rescue operations, and target-finding with multi-UAS systems. Multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are a type of artificial intelligence technology in which many agents collaborate to perform tasks. When a multi-UAS cooperative navigation technique is deployed to a complicated environment such as an urban logistics system, the agents learning capacities become more tedious. In this study, we present what is termed the improved Multi-Actor-Attention-Critic (iMAAC) approach, a modified multi-agent reinforcement learning method for application to urban airmobility logistic services. A virtual simulation environment based on Unity is created to validate the suggested method. In the virtual environment, the real-world situation of UAS logistics development services is replicated. When the findings are compared to those of other landmark reinforcement algorithms, iMAAC shows a higher learning rate than those by the other algorithms when utilized in multi-agent systems. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A

Simulations of UAM in urban environment are conducted. Firstly, quadrotor configuration is determined as the research object of this paper. Based on the flight dynamic equations, the 6-DOF mathematical model of quad-rotor UAS is established. A flight control law based on nonlinear dynamic inversion method is designed for the quadrotor to follow the expected path. Then, the airspace below 120m is divided into several layers. UAM aircrafts with a similar flight heading fly in a same layer and the vertical separation of high risk UAM aircrafts can be maintained. The flight profile of UAM aircraft is designed based on the layered airspace, including the flight attitude and heading in the flight phases. Finally, to verify the concept proposed in this paper, several mathematic simulations are conducted based on the urban airspace environment described above. The simulations include complete flight processes of multi-UAM in layered airspace. The simulation data is collected and results are analyzed. It is concluded that with proper management of airspace and flight control algorithm, this work is able to simulate the UAM operation in urban environment. The proposed airspace management method could be effective to guarantee the flight safety of UAM. At last of this paper, the research conclusion and expected future work are discussed. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A

With the high potential of eVTOL aircraft for practical use in Southeast Asia, identifying which countries and use cases are promising is necessary. We conducted interviews with doctors of two institutions with helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) in Thailand to elucidate current challenges in HEMS and airframe requirements for emergency medical services (EMS) use case. Next, we conducted interviews with 12 local stakeholders in the Philippines and Thailand to gain information on the challenges surrounding the implementation of eVTOLs for the Sightseeing/Leisure and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) use cases within the specified locations. Then, we quantitatively evaluated the stakeholder perceptions using the Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix to select promising use cases. Finally, we performed Fermi estimate to calculate the market size with constraints. The results showed that HEMS in Thailand needs two-seater eVTOLs to dispatch only a doctor to the field as in Japan, however, the feasibility of this use case is lower than other use cases considering the specifications required by doctors. The Sightseeing/Leisure use case in Cebu is the best use case for eVTOL implementation with stakeholder perceptions in mind, whereas the UAM use case in Bangkok is better for sales. 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A

10.1186/s40309-022-00198-3;2022;M.+Woznica;Stage Performances As Means For Linking Sociotechnical Imaginaries And Projective Genres In The Discourse Around Urban Air Mobility;Sociotechnical imaginaries play a crucial role in the context of urban air mobility. At the beginning of this article, I present the Pop.Up, commonly described as air taxi, as one such vision. Taking the analysis of multiple visions as an orientation, I show secondly, how other temporal figures such as projective genres fulfil different functions to establish specific visions as dominant ones. By examining a press release about the Pop.Up, I show how distant futures are constructed trough explicating the problem of congestion in metropolitan cities. With the analysis of the stage performance by stakeholders from Airbus and Italdesign during the Geneva Motor Show 2017, where the Pop.Up was unveiled for the first time, I thirdly show that different futures fulfill different functions. Sociotechnical imaginaries visualized by concept videos demonstrate necessity, whereas projective genres communicated on a stage as collaborative action plans demonstrate feasibility. Stage performances, such as the one at the motor show, where the concept video was shown, offer a framework to establish specific sociotechnical visions. This linking between different future dimensions can be described as performative discourse strategy to make an artifact, in this case the Pop.Up, communicatively connectable to political discourses. The analysis of futures such as sociotechnical imaginaries regarding the question of politicization processes is thus supplemented by a perspective that examines projective genres such as collaborative action plans. 2022, The Author(s).;N/A

Numerical models have been developed and validated as predictive tools to analyze rotor aerodynamics and wake dynamics. Among various numerical approaches, the vortex method is one of the most suitable because it can provide accurate solutions with an affordable computational cost and can represent vorticity fields downstream without numerical dissipation error. This paper presents a brief review of the progress of vortex methods, along with their principles, advantages, and shortcomings. Applications of the vortex methods for modeling the rotor aerodynamics and wake dynamics are also described. However, the vortex methods suffer from the problem that it cannot deal with the nonlinear aerodynamic characteristics associated with the viscous effects and the flow behaviors in the post-stall regime. To overcome the intrinsic drawbacks of the vortex methods, recent progress in a numerical method proposed by the authors is introduced, and model validation against experimental data is discussed in detail. The validation works show that nonlinear vortex lattice method (NVLM) coupled with vortex particle method (VPM) can predict the unsteady aerodynamic forces and complex evolution of the rotor wake. 2022, The Author(s).;N/A

Modern VTOL designs feature a variety of configurations involving rotors, lifting surfaces and bluff bodies. The resulting aerodynamics are highly impacted by the interactions between those components and their wakes. This has consequences on the aircraft performance and on the downstream wake. Studying the effects of those interactions through CFD can inform the development of cheaper numerical models. In this work, we focus on the interaction between rotors and bluff bodies based on the example of a generic quadcopter in forward flight. Using the Vortex ParticleMesh method, a CFD method well-suited for wake studies, we analyze the influence of the rotor-airframe interaction on the loads and on the development of the aircraft near wake. Our results show that the presence of the airframe induces a change in average thrust of maximum 2.4% on the rear rotors. Correspondingly, the contribution of the rotors to the overall aircraft lift and drag changes by less than 2%, suggesting that the airframe can be ignored if one seeks a simple model of the rotor forces. On the other hand, the airframe experiences peak loads due to its proximity with the blades. Thus, the rotor-airframe interaction must be accounted for in the prediction of airframe loads. Finally, comparing simulations with and without the airframe, we find that the trailing wake vortices converge to circulations less than 0.2% different. However, the vortex spacing decreases when the airframe is accounted for. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;N/A
10.1016/j.ast.2022.107876;2022;H.+U.+Koyuncuoglu P.+He;Simultaneous Wing Shape And Actuator Parameter Optimization Using The Adjoint Method;Increasing attention to urban air mobility with distributed electric propulsion causes an increased interest in propeller aircraft design and optimization. Various studies have focused on designing and optimizing the aerodynamic performance of wings and propellers. However, existing studies optimized the wing and propeller separately due to the numerical challenges in simulations and optimization. It is not clear to what extent high-fidelity coupled wing-propeller aerodynamic optimization can benefit the propeller aircraft design. As a first step to answer the above question, this study develops the capability to simultaneously optimize the wing shape and actuator parameters. We use a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics solver to simulate the wing aerodynamics, and the propeller is modeled as an actuator disk. We develop a smoothed actuator disk formulation that allows us to change the actuator's location and radius during the optimization, along with the wing shape. We use the discrete adjoint approach to compute the derivatives and couple them with a gradient-based optimization framework. The benefit of the above adjoint-based optimization framework is that it can use a large number of design variables to allow large design freedom for both wing and actuator. We perform 15 optimizations to evaluate how various actuator parameters impact the wing aerodynamic performance, both single and double actuator configurations are considered. We observe that the spanwise location and outer radius are the two most important actuator parameters, and using more actuator parameters as the design variables result in better performance. For example, optimizing the wing shape while allowing the actuator location and outer radius to move exhibits 11.4% more drag reduction compared with optimizing the wing shape while fixing the actuator parameters. This study serves as the starting point for more detailed high-fidelity coupled wing-propeller aerodynamic optimizations. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;N/A

Through engaging users and stakeholders early in the design process we can gain insights before the physical environments are built. This paper presents data from a truly novel application of Virtual Reality (VR), where user experience and wayfinding were evaluated within an emerging future transport infrastructure to support urban air mobility (UAM)  the urban airport (aka vertiports). Urban airports are located in city centres where drones or flying cars would land and take off from. Previous quantitative studies have investigated passenger experience in traditional airports using field observation and surveys, but this paper is the first to present qualitative research on user experience in this emerging mobility infrastructure using an immersive VR environment. Twenty participants completed a series of six scenarios aimed at understanding customer exciters and pain points within an urban airport. Results and recommendations from this empirical research will help inform the design of all future mobility infrastructure solutions, through improving user experience before the infrastructure is physically deployed. Finally, this paper highlights the benefits of engaging users at an early stage of the design process to ensure that future transport infrastructure will be accessible, easy to navigate and a pleasure to use. 2022 The Authors;N/A

Globalisation and consumerism in society significantly contributed to intensify the demand for services in freight transport. Technological breakthroughs and the related development of innovation fed the constant search for faster and cheaper services on a global scale. Altogether, these driving forces have boosted a rapid increase in the volume of freight transport by means of road transport. While industry had modified its networks to meet the demand, the pandemic period brought new challenges to freight networks, forcing the different modes of transport to adapt to the unexpected environment. Some of those reactive solutions might have been adopted temporarily. However, others are expected to become permanent and their deployment in the short-medium term remains to be seen. This chapter presents an overview of the challenges and respective solutions that were initiated throughout the pandemic period, mostly in response to concerns related to social distance and untypical demand needs. This overview allows for a better foretelling of the future directions and developments in the freight network elements. This chapter approaches the way forward for cities and industry regarding the lasting pandemic effects on freight networks. Such an overview is complemented by an input from an expert survey in order to evaluate the social acceptability towards the expected solutions that are emerging. The outcome of the chapter highlights the main guidelines for the freight networks in the future and correlates them with the pandemics permanent effects. 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.;N/A

The electrical machine determines the weight of the distributed electric propulsion system, and the cooling capability determines the electrical machines weight. The electrical machine with air cooling is preferred for eVTOL due to its simplicity and light weight. This paper presents a new air-cooling system for an electrical machine in an electric ducted fan propulsion system. The novel cooling system consists of a cooling guide vane with a heat pipe (CGVHP), which is located downstream of the ducted fan rotating blade. The heated end of the heat pipe is inserted into the stator end windings and the cold end is inserted into the cooling guide vane. The heat generated in the windings is transmitted to the cooling guide vane by the heat pipe and dissipated by the forced convection using low-temperature air passing through the ducted fan. The cooling performance of the cooling guide vane with the heat pipe was numerically simulated, considering several critical design factors.

10.2514/1.D0278;2022;M.+T.+Kotwicz E.+Ylmaz O.+Sanni B.+J.+German;Drawing The Highways In The Sky For Urban Air Mobility Operations;Urban air mobility (UAM) is a new mode of intracity transportation that promises to free commuters of ground congestion by providing air-taxi services within dense metropolitan environments. The introduction of UAM operations into the airspace, however, brings challenges related to the efficient and equitable management of UAM air traffic, particularly with regard to trajectory assignment and optimization. Near-term UAM missions are anticipated to operate within structured airspace corridors, leading to the interesting problem of corridor formation. In this paper, we describe a minimum-cost, network flow optimization framework that provides global optimal corridors for a given set of origin-destination pairs, subject to airspace metrics such as airspace density, complexity, and flexibility. The framework is applied to both small-scale scenarios that demonstrate the behavior of the framework and a full-scale scenario representative of the Atlanta metropolitan area. This work contributes to understanding how to effectively integrate UAM into the airspace. 2022 by the authors.

10.2514/1.D0275;2022;M.+Fu A.+Straubinger J.+Schaumeier;Scenario-Based Demand Assessment Of Urban Air Mobility In The Greater Munich Area;In this work, we project the idea of aerial passenger transport in the near future: on-demand urban air mobility (UAM) for the greater Munich area in the year 2030. We propose a simulation framework that facilitates analyzing the potential demand of UAM. We define five scenarios (ranging from representations of a niche application to a mass transport option) by varying the fleet size, available technologies, infrastructure placement, and pricing strategies. These scenarios are fed into an extended version of the agent-based transport simulation platform MATSim chained with the microscopic transportation orchestrator. The simulation results show that the system configuration has a big impact on UAM demand. The infrastructure capacity and fleet size were identified as the main bottlenecks. We see high levels of demand during peak hours and for trips up to 20 km, however, none of the scenarios result in a sufficiently high modal share of UAM that substantially reduces traffic volumes of ground-based modes, and hence have no significant impact on congestion. Yet, the different trip purposes generate significantly different demands. UAM for airport access could be an especially relevant modal choice in the premium airport-passenger segment. When aiming for an effective and sustainable UAM service, our recommendations are as follows: first, use it to support and improve, rather than cannibalize, existing public transport options, and second, minimize negative impacts on the environment and society to maximize public acceptance. 2022 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.;N/A
10.1016/j.jairtraman.2022.102294;2022;S.+Rath J.+Y.+J.+Chow;Air Taxi Skyport Location Problem With Single-Allocation Choice-Constrained Elastic Demand For Airport Access;Witnessing the accelerated commercialization efforts for air taxi services in across metropolitan cities, our research focuses on infrastructure planning of skyports. We consider design of skyport locations for air taxis accessing airports, where we present the skyport location problem as a modified single-allocation p-hub median location problem integrating choice-constrained user mode choice behavior. Our approach focuses on two alternative objectives i.e., maximizing air taxi ridership and maximizing air taxi revenue. The proposed models in the study incorporate trade-offs between trip length and trip cost based on mode choice behavior of travelers to determine optimal choices of skyports in a city. We examine the sensitivity of skyport locations based on two objectives, three air taxi pricing strategies, and varying transfer times at skyports. A case study of New York City is conducted considering a network of 149 taxi zones and 3 airports with over 20 million for-hire-vehicles trip data to the airports to discuss insights around the choice of skyport locations in the city, and demand allocation to different skyports under various parameter settings. Results suggest that a minimum of 9 skyports located between Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn can adequately accommodate the airport access travel needs and are sufficiently stable against transfer time increases. Findings from this study can help air taxi providers strategize infrastructure design options and investment decisions based on skyport location choices. 2022 Elsevier Ltd;N/A

This paper investigates the urban airflow characteristics that are expected to pose significant challenges to the flight of unmanned aircraft systems and impair their aerodynamic stability. Using experimental methods, a 1:400 scale city model was tested in an Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) wind tunnel at various wind incidence angles to capture a representative range of wind speed changes, wind direction changes, wind shear and turbulence intensity flow features. The results can be used as a first step in informing regulations for UAS operations in urban flows, where the most severe flow conditions are those which contribute to develop operational limits. This paper reveals the severity of the flow conditions in representative urban environments, particularly around and between the buildings. 2022;N/A

However, air delivery service will not scale up without proper traffic management for drones in dense urban environment. Currently, a range of Concepts of Operations (ConOps) for unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) are being proposed and evaluated by researchers, operators, and regulators. Among these, the tube-based (or corridor-based) ConOps has emerged in operations in some regions of the world for drone deliveries and is expected to continue serving certain scenarios that with dense and complex airspace and requires centralized control in the future. Towards the tube-based ConOps, we develop a route network planning method to design routes (tubes) in a complex urban environment in this paper. In this method, we propose a priority structure to decouple the network planning problem, which is NP-hard, into single-path planning problems. We also introduce a novel space cost function to enable the design of dense and aligned routes in a network. The proposed method is tested on various scenarios and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our method can generate near-optimal route networks with significant computational time-savings. 2022 The Author(s);N/A

This paper aims to provide an in-depth qualitative analysis of relevant aspects of UAM development and implementation. The added value of this paper is in assessing the current status and prospects of the most important UAM areas by analysing them from the literature and practice point of views.

Such environments are especially dangerous due to their high population and structural density in combination with challenging atmospheric conditions. Particularly the local wind field with its often unknown wind shear and turbulence characteristics endangers manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. Therefore, knowledge of the local turbulent wind is essential to ensure safety for the aircraft and the people onboard as well as on ground and should thus be incorporated in mission planning. This study presents a framework of how atmospheric flow analyses can contribute to safe drone operations in urban environments. High-resolution simulations are carried out, utilizing the large-eddy simulation model PALM, which can resolve turbulent flow and building structures down to the meter scale. Our results highlight the advantages and the necessity of using turbulence-resolving models to reasonably arrange a future drone operation network within cities. Because large-eddy simulations of urban environments are still computationally expensive, a meteorological data base for each urban setup should be established to obtain the relevant wind information for mission planning. 2022 The Author(s);N/A

Such an aerial robot is envisioned for use in an urban setting where noise restrictions are in place in certain zones necessitating battery only operation. We consider the discrete version of this problem, where a graph is constructed by sampling the boundaries of the restricted zones, and develop a path planning algorithm. The planner simultaneously solves the path planing along with the energy mode switching control, under battery constraints and noise restrictions. This is a coupled problem involving discrete decision making to find the path to travel, and determining the state of charge of the battery along the path, which is a continuous variable. A sampling based algorithm to find near optimal solution to this problem is presented. To quantify the efficacy of the solution, an algorithm that computes tight lower bounds is also presented. The algorithms presented are verified using numerical simulations, and the average gap between the feasible solutions (upper bounds) and the lower bounds are, empirically, shown to be within 15% of each other. 2022 IEEE.;N/A
10.4324/9781003332824;2022;N.+K.+Taneja;Airimagination: Extending The Airline Business Boundaries;Unprecedented social changes, accelerated by facilitating technologies and the COVID-19 pandemic, are calling for airlines to think deeply and non-conventionally on what will be important to existing and new travelers, as they change their lifestyles. New thinking requires airlines to extend the boundaries of their businesses to go beyond their traditional domains. This need goes beyond the renovation and iteration of conventional products to the transformation of products requiring new ideas and ways to scale them. Examples include the development of cost-effective urban air mobility, intermodal passenger transportation, door-to-door travel that is sustainable, and personalized offers. Airimagination: Extending the Airline Business Boundaries raises some thought-provoking questions and provides a direction for practical solutions. For example, what if airlines developed products and services that finally meet end-to-end needs of customers seamlessly by collaborating in the value-adding open ecosystems, using platforms that facilitate effective engagement with both digital and nondigital customers and employees in real time and at each touch point? Ironically, the current time is an advantage for some airlines as they already have had to deal with a deep and wide disruption caused by the pandemic, leading operations to start from ground zero. This book, the latest in a long and well-regarded series by Nawal K. Taneja, explores innovative best practices within the airline business world, complemented by numerous insightful perspectives contained in multiple forewords and thought leadership pieces.

10.4204/EPTCS.371.7;2022;S.+Murthy N.+A.+Neogi S.+Bharadwaj;Scheduling For Urban Air Mobility Using Safe Learning;This work considers the scheduling problem for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles travelling between origin-destination pairs with both hard and soft trip deadlines. Each route is described by a discrete probability distribution over trip completion times (or delay) and over inter-arrival times of requests (or demand) for the route along with a fixed hard or soft deadline. Soft deadlines carry a cost that is incurred when the deadline is missed. An online, safe scheduler is developed that ensures that hard deadlines are never missed and that average cost of missing soft deadlines is minimized. The system is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and safe model based learning is used to find the probabilistic distributions over route delays and demand. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is used to safely explore the learned models in an online fashion and develop a near-optimal non-preemptive scheduling policy. These results are compared with Value Iteration (VI) and MCTS (Random) scheduling solutions. 2022 Open Publishing Association. All rights reserved.;N/A

UAV's contribution is increasing in day-to-day life, whether it is in a military zone, disaster management, healthcare sector, smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), urban air mobility, and many more. In contrast, UAV's limited computational capability and low-energy sources pose significant challenges for real-time data processing, storage, networking, and security that are critical in emergencies such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones. UAVs are rapidly used to satisfy user requirements as well as services. As the demand for UAVs aided heterogeneous wireless networks increases in critical emergencies, fog computing serves several benefits to fulfill users' demands in terms of low latency, support, data storage, mobility, availability, scalability, and so on. This study aims to present a comprehensive study with their technical aspects for understanding fog computing, security issues, privacy concerns, and risks, along with its solutions. This paper suggests the collaboration of UAV-Fog architecture based on the four-tier network consisting of smart things, local UAVs, UAV-Fog, and cloud server, to control UAV's data and also described some of the security issues faced by this cloud infrastructure. Further, this research article also sheds new light on some scenarios of UAV-Fog for such deployments, applications, opportunities, challenges, and their major security threats and their countermeasures.

10.3390/ijerph191811298;2022;J.+Kim;Urban Air Mobility Noise: Further Considerations On Indoor Space;Various countries are preparing for the introduction of urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, which move freely within the space above a city, as a new means of urban transportation. However, UAM vehicles present new forms of challenges to many urban residents. This study aims to propose newly sensory standards for the noise levels of UAM vehicles in urban indoor spaces based on two fundamental questions: (1) Would UAM vehicles not have a lower and wider impact on city residents than a commercial aircraft? (2) Should the flight of UAM vehicles not consider the sensory noise, like the conventional noise standard? UAM vehicles, unlike commercial aircrafts, will cause noise pollution in a broad area of the city. Therefore, expanded aircraft noise standards will be required. In addition, the hybridized noise generated by conventional vehicles in the ground and UAM vehicles in the air will affect urban residents. Furthermore, urban residents will be exposed to sensory noise from UAM vehicles, which fly directly above them but not within their line of sight. Therefore, the noise standards for UAM vehicles should include the sensory properties in addition to the physical properties in the existing noise standards. 2022 by the author.;N/A

This study proposes a method of comparing air pollutant emissions from using ground transportation versus switching to multimodal UAM, including greenhouse gases and other air pollutants (NOx, SO2, PM2.5). A study by Wu and Zhang (2021) addressed planning questions regarding the optimal placement of vertiports and estimated diverted demand from ground transportation modes by combining network design and travel mode choice models. The proposed method is applied to the case study of Tampa Bay region. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to further evaluate the impacts. The study reveals that on-demand UAM (considering vertiport access and egress modes) generates more greenhouse gases and other air pollutants (except NOx) in the case study region compared to ground transportation modes. The emissions depend on the structure of power production. A lower UAM service price and more vertiports will further increase emissions. 2022 Elsevier Ltd;N/A

So far, only large passenger aircraft, a few general aviation aircraft, and specialized rotorcraft are equipped with ice protection systems because of their additional energy consumption and weight. The emerging markets of small electric aircraft like Urban Air Mobility and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for transportation, logistics, search and rescue, and other specialized operations will require efficient, lightweight and all-electric ice protection systems in order to allow operations in ice and snow conditions. In this work, an electrothermal ice protection system with an average heat power density of 1 W cm2 was designed and developed for use on small multirotor drones. Commercially available propeller blades with diameters of 33 cm were retrofitted with lightweight multilayer heating foils independently powered by super-capacitors. The heated propellers were tested in close-to-real icing conditions in a small-scale icing wind tunnel. Thrust, rotational speed, and power consumption of a non-heated reference propeller and a heated propeller were compared. In glaze ice conditions at air temperatures &gt, 5 C the thrust of the non-heated propeller fluctuated between 60 and 90% with frequent cycles of ice accretion and shedding for the entire duration of the test. The heated propeller maintained a thrust of &gt,95% in the same icing conditions. In rime ice conditions at air temperatures &lt, 8 C the heating was not sufficient and the thrust of the non-heated and heated propellers similarly decreased over time. Heat flux calculations along the span of the propeller were made for different icing conditions and compared to the heat power density distribution of the tested ice protection system. 2022;N/A

With the advancement of technologies, robotic applications have evolved to integrate multiple distributed robots. As a result, the integration of formal verification-based methods to assure the correctness of the interactions between multiple distributed robots has become ever more important. However, going from formally verified models designed in formal environments/software such as UPPAAL to robotic simulation software such as robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Nonetheless, such a translation from formal to simulation environment is essential for robotic applications that are going to be deployed in the real world, for obvious economical and safety reasons. In this article, we provide our insights into the development of a framework that integrates design and formal verification at a higher level of abstraction and then performing a translation to ROS, focusing on a scenario for distributed drones representing urban air mobility. Through this article, we seek to accelerate the development cycle in transitioning from formally verified systems to simulation. 2007-2012 IEEE.;N/A
10.1109/TITS.2022.3140724;2022;J.+Bertram P.+Wei J.+Zambreno;A Fast Markov Decision Process-Based Algorithm For Collision Avoidance In Urban Air Mobility;Multiple aircraft collision avoidance is a challenging problem due to a stochastic environment and uncertainty in the intent of other aircraft. Traditionally a layered approach to collision avoidance has been employed using a centralized air traffic control system, established rules of the road, separation assurance, and last minute pairwise collision avoidance. With the advent of Urban Air Mobility (air taxis), the expected increase in traffic density in urban environments, short time scales, and small distances between aircraft favor decentralized decision making on-board the aircraft. In this paper, we present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based method, named FastMDP, which can solve a certain subclass of MDPs quickly, and demonstrate using the algorithm online to safely maintain separation and avoid collisions with multiple aircraft (1-on-n) while remaining computationally efficient. We compare the FastMDP algorithms performance against two online collision avoidance algorithms that have been shown to be both efficient and scale to large numbers of aircraft: Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our simulation results show that under the assumption that aircraft do not have perfect knowledge of other aircraft intent FastMDP outperforms ORCA and MCTS in collision avoidance behavior in terms of loss of separation and near mid-air collisions while being more computationally efficient. We further show that in our simulation FastMDP behaves nearly as well as MCTS with perfect knowledge of other aircraft intent. Our results show that FastMDP is a promising algorithm for collision avoidance that is also computationally efficient. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

The operation model of UAM is expected to be diverse, and the installation form for the ground infrastructure will vary depending on the operation model. Therefore, before the commercialization of UAM, it is necessary to derive a UAM operation model suitable for an urban area. A suitable UAM operation model is expected to vary depending on the spatial structure of this urban area, but research on this is insufficient. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to categorize metropolitan areas based on its urban spatial structural characteristics related to UAM operation and to propose a UAM operation model suitable for each type. This study analyzed Functional Urban Areas (FUA) classified by the OECD. FUAs with a population of more than 1.5 million were extracted, and 105 FUAs from 23 countries were included in this study. By constructing urban spatial structure characteristic variable data related to UAM operation, factor analysis was conducted, and cluster analysis was performed using these factor scores. The analysis results revealed four types of FUA were derived: a sprawl metropolitan area, a multi-centered urban area, a low-income high-density urban area, and a high-income low-density urban area. MaaS and Air Metro models were suitable for the sprawl metropolitan area. For multi-centered urban areas, the PAV and Air Taxi models were suitable. The Air Metro model was suitable for low-income high-density urban areas. Lastly, the PAV and Air Taxi models were suitable for high-income low-density urban areas. 2022 Architectural Institute of Korea.;N/A

For that purpose, a commercial model was simulated using the specifications of the manufacturer along with empirical measurements to determine the scanning pattern of the device. With the point clouds generated by the sensor, the system detects the presence of intruders and estimates their motion to finally compute avoidance trajectories using a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP) in real time. The method was tested in different scenarios, offering robust results. Execution times were of the order of 50 milliseconds, allowing the implementation in real time on modern onboard computers. 2022 by the authors.;N/A

This paper evaluates the performance and practical challenges associated with fabricating and flight testing an unmanned aircraft powered by a turboelectric system based on a 7 kW turbine engine. Emerging hybrid gas-electric aircraft concepts have been the subject of numerous design studies and analytical evaluations, however, there is a critical need to identify and assess practical issues associated with integrating a hybrid turboelectric power system into an aircraft. The purpose of this study, relevant to emerging hybrid-powered aircraft, is to evaluate and retrofit a prototype turboelectric power system to an existing 391 N gross take-off weight unmanned airframe. The representative 7 kW turboelectric system was installed to identify challenges and to formulate data-driven recommendations for general application to urban air mobility. This work addresses performance, power and thermal management, vibration, and acoustic emissions. Results include a weight breakdown with the turboelectric system making up 21% of the total aircraft weight, in-flight voltage and current measurements with maximum loads observed during a dive pull-out, temperature measurements, accelerometer measurements, and far field sound pressure level measurements. Practical recommendations from this study are applicable to power system reliability, electronic component selection, cooling requirements, and peak power behavior, informing the design of future hybrid gaselectric aircraft. 2022 by the authors.;N/A

Visual sensors have the potential of providing accurate measurements with reduced budgets, although integrity issues, as well as performance degradation in low visibility and highly dynamic environments, may pose challenges. In this context, this paper focuses on autonomous navigation during vertical approach and landing procedures and provides three main contributions. First, visual sensing requirements relevant to Urban Air Mobility scenarios are defined considering realistic landing trajectories, landing pad dimensions, and wind effects. Second, a multi-sensor-based navigation architecture based on an Extended Kalman Filter is presented which integrates visual estimates with inertial and GNSS measurements and includes different operating modes and ad hoc integrity checks. The presented processing pipeline is built to provide the required navigation performance in different conditions including day/night flight, atmospheric disturbances, low visibility, and can support the autonomous initialization of a missed approach procedure. Third, performance assessment of the proposed architecture is conducted within a highly realistic simulation environment which reproduces real world scenarios and includes variable weather and illumination conditions. Results show that the proposed architecture is robust with respect to dynamic and environmental challenges, providing cm-level positioning uncertainty in the final landing phase. Furthermore, autonomous initialization of a Missed Approach Procedure is demonstrated in case of loss of visual contact with the landing pad and consequent increase of the self-estimated navigation uncertainty. 2022 by the authors.;N/A

Early discussions on this have been technology-focused, pointing at the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for cargo delivery and electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft for passenger transportation. Recently, the term Urban Air Mobility has become widely used to encompass these vehicles within a new mobility ecosystem. However, due to deficiencies in this term, other proposals  namely Advanced Air Mobility, New Air Mobility and Innovative Air Mobility  have emerged. The rise in different terms can lead to confusion as their scope is not always fully known or appreciated, and they are often used interchangeably. This paper, therefore, shifts focus from the recent debate about the definition of UAS to the aforementioned ecosystem terms so to address and evaluate them as potentially different aspects of the same concept. An interpretive approach of the terms, an assessment of their major characteristics, as well as an analysis of their relationship with the aircraft types will take place. This will show the scope of these terms so that the context can be properly understood and then appropriately applied. 2022, The Author(s).;N/A

This paper introduces a risk-bounded and fairness-aware path planning algorithm for multiple electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft operating in such environments. This algorithm advances the sampling-based path planning with the risk domain formulation to generate stochastically safety assured collision-free paths that are robust to both vehicle and environmental obstacle uncertainties for multiple eVTOL aircraft. To address the concern of flight fairness between different eVTOLs in the free flight airspace, the strategy of permit assignment is introduced. By incorporating the risk domain formulation into the sampling-based path planning with the strategy of permit assignment, the algorithm proposed in this paper not only inherits the computational advantage of the sampling-based methods, but also guarantees a stochastically feasible flying zone at every time step. Simulation studies demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;N/A
10.1016/j.tra.2022.06.004;2022;J.+Hae Y.+Park;Exploring Economic Feasibility For Airport Shuttle Service Of Urban Air Mobility (Uam);UAM is a new concept of mobility that expands the two-dimensional transportation system to three dimensions using a personal air vehicle (PAV). This study explores the economic feasibility of the UAM airport shuttle service from two perspectives. First, this study estimates the fare of UAM services to attract customers. The UAM service should maintain a competitive price to convert existing transportation users into UAM users. This study used Incheon Airport (ICN) ground transportation data to estimate a competitive fare based on the multinomial logit model. The pricing range at which UAM services can obtain users from Seoul Station to ICN is estimated to be 96 to 108 USD, assuming the new service reduces traveling time by 3040 min compared to taxi service. The comparison with professional institutions indicates that the 96108 USD price range is feasible. However, according to a simulation based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, other approaches to increase economic feasibility are required. Second, this study reviewed operational policies to improve the economic feasibility of UAM shuttle services from two perspectives. The first is a service perspective that introduces new services or enhances the current service level. The internalization of CNS (communications, navigation, and surveillance) and UTM (unmanned traffic management) services can be a new business area, including premium routing. The second is introducing a dynamic pricing policy. Segmented pricing, time-based pricing, and changing market conditions strategies can practically strengthen the economic feasibility. Operating an airport Vertiport providing a dedicated path for UAM passengers can allow UAM operators to charge more on a premium passenger segment by shortening airport procedure time. Because it can avoid the uncertainty of road congestion, there is plenty of incentive to set higher fares during peak times with severe congestion. In addition, by creating a market environment in which multiple operators participate, the operators can share the burden of infrastructure construction and operation, which account for more than 80% of the total operating costs, increasing the economic feasibility of services. 2022;N/A
10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132139;2022;S.+H.+Cho M.+Kim;Assessment Of The Environmental Impact And Policy Responses For Urban Air Mobility: A Case Study Of Seoul Metropolitan Area;Urban air mobility (UAM) is expected to be a new alternative future transportation system to overcome the limitations of infrastructure investment and resolve traffic congestion cost issues in urban areas. This study aims to estimate the parameters of the mode choice model incorporating the cleaner transportation mode and evaluate the environmental impact by calculating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ground traffic. A stated preference survey is employed to estimate the parameters for each travel mode, including the emerging travel mode. The awareness and experience of the air travel modes remove the hesitation concerning travel mode choice having positive values, but concerns about taking new types of air mobility reduce the probability of choosing urban air mobility. The macroscopic travel demand forecasting program simulates the travel demand of urban air mobility to calculate the reduction of CO2 emissions between before and after the introduction. While about 30 thousand of urban air mobility travel demand are generated after the introduction of urban air mobility in the urban area, it reduces about 90 thousand tons of CO2 emissions from the ground traffic. The introduction of urban air mobility causes modal shifts from ground traffic, reducing climate change and global warming. Policymakers should evaluate the feasibility of introducing urban air mobility, including environmental impact assessment, and an appropriate transit fare policy is required for the proliferation of urban air mobility. 2022;N/A

The integration of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) provides globally uniform coordinate information, and the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) gives stable and accurate local pose estimates. However, the error of the integrated INS/GNSS increases rapidly in GNSS-challenged environments, and the VIO system suffers from the long-term error accumulation. To cope with these difficulties, this paper proposes a new tightly coupled Visual-Inertial-GNSS (VIG) system to achieve robust and drift-free pose estimation utilising GNSS raw measurements, image features, and inertial measurements. A novel compressed state constraint Kalman Filter (CSCKF) is formulated to combine time-propagated feature measurements and differential GNSS observations to aid INS. Compared to the conventional integrated navigation systems, the proposed CSCKF-based VIG system is advantageous in maintaining the minimum number of states without unnecessary state augmentation and no loss of performance. The proposed system is evaluated by field experiments in different GNSS availability situations. The results show that accuracy is improved significantly in GNSS-degraded environments compared to that of the conventional systems. 2022 The Authors.

10.3390/app12147260;2022;L.+Preis M.+Hornung;A Vertiport Design Heuristic To Ensure Efficient Ground Operations For Urban Air Mobility;Urban Air Mobility is a novel concept of transportation with unknown market potential. Even in conservative estimates, thousands of operations could be expected on a single vertiport. This exceeds known heliport operations, which is the most comparable existing mode of transportby far. Vertiport operations, in particular the dynamics on the airfield, are not well understood, in the following article, we want to address this research gap. By using means of agent-based simulation, the following design drivers were identified: peaks in demand, imbalance between arrivals and departures, pad operations and gate operations. We calculate a practical hourly capacity of 264 movements for our baseline scenario consisting of 4 pads, 12 gates and 20 stand. We are further able to shown that avoiding this peak and staying below a maximum imbalance between arrivals and departures of less than 33 ensures an average passenger delay of less than 3 min. Lastly, we present a parameter study varying the number of pads and gates, the length of approach/departure and boarding/de-boarding and the level of demand. The results of this study are aggregated into a graphical design heuristic displaying the interchangeability of the mentioned aspects. 2022 by the authors.;N/A

The aim of the study is to enhance the usefulness of UAV delivery services in urban areas, evaluating what kinds of UAVs are more environment friendly than freight trains, with regard to particulate matter emissions and global warming potential. Under evaluation conditions, freight train delivery was a significantly better alternative in terms of particulate matter emissions, regardless of the size and energy source of the UAVs. However, despite freight trains being a well-known eco-friendly mode of transportation, it can be seen from this study that small UAVs satisfied a few conditions that could potentially provide a good transportation alternative, with low global warming potential. This paper provides important insights into the comparison of UAVs and freight trains with regard to carbon and particulate matter emissions, highlighting the implications that, in some situations, UAVs can be a feasible alternative for policymakers who prepare policy measures of an activation plan for UAM (urban air mobility). 2022 by the authors.;N/A
10.3390/drones6070179;2022;K.+Schweiger L.+Preis;Urban Air Mobility: Systematic Review Of Scientific Publications And Regulations For Vertiport Design And Operations;Novel electric aircraft designs coupled with intense efforts from academia, government and industry led to a paradigm shift in urban transportation by introducing UAM. While UAM promises to introduce a new mode of transport, it depends on ground infrastructure to operate safely and efficiently in a highly constrained urban environment. Due to its novelty, the research of UAM ground infrastructure is widely scattered. Therefore, this paper selects, categorizes and summarizes existing literature in a systematic fashion and strives to support the harmonization process of contributions made by industry, research and regulatory authorities. Through a document term matrix approach, we identified 49 Scopus-listed scientific publications (20162021) addressing the topic of UAM ground infrastructure with respect to airspace operation followed by design, location and network, throughput and capacity, ground operations, cost, safety, regulation, weather and lastly noise and security. Last listed topics from cost onwards appear to be substantially under-represented, but will be influencing current developments and challenges. This manuscript further presents regulatory considerations (Europe, U.S., international) and introduces additional noteworthy scientific publications and industry contributions. Initial uncertainties in naming UAM ground infrastructure seem to be overcome, vertiport is now being predominantly used when speaking about vertical take-off and landing UAM operations. 2022 by the authors.;N/A
10.1177/03611981221076839;2022;P.+Yedavalli A.+Cohen;Planning Land Use Constrained Networks Of Urban Air Mobility Infrastructure In The San Francisco Bay Area;Urban air mobility (UAM) is a concept envisioning safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible air transportation for passenger mobility, cargo delivery, and emergency management within or traversing a metropolitan area. While the deployment of UAM will require a network of infrastructure (i.e., vertiports), this emerging concept could face a variety of barriers, such as local opposition, infrastructure costs, and multimodal integration. This paper presents a novel simulation methodology using k-medians clustering and sensitivity analysis to model potential vertiport locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. When controlling for land use characteristics (i.e., parcel size and zoning), the simulation and sensitivity analysis finds that as the number of vertiports increases, the average travel times of trips taken by UAM decrease. The analysis also identifies an inflection point of the number of vertiports at which UAM becomes competitive with driving. The analysis concludes that with respect to size, parcels of 2 acres or smaller are the only locations that allow UAM travel times to be competitive with driving. The paper concludes that neither quantitative nor qualitative factors alone will be sufficient to determine the feasibility of vertiports and overcome community concerns associated with vertiport siting. Metropolitan planning organizations, local governments, and other public agencies will likely need to augment technical analysis with robust stakeholder and community engagement throughout the planning process.

10.3390/fluids7070246;2022;A.+Garca-Gutirrez J.+Gonzalo D.+Lpez A.+Delgado;Advances In Cfd Modeling Of Urban Wind Applied To Aerial Mobility;The feasibility, safety, and efficiency of a drone mission in an urban environment are heavily influenced by atmospheric conditions. However, numerical meteorological models cannot cope with fine-grained grids capturing urban geometries, they are typically tuned for best resolutions ranging from 1 to 10 km. To enable urban air mobility, new now-casting techniques are being developed based on different techniques, such as data assimilation, variational analysis, machine-learning algorithms, and time series analysis. Most of these methods require generating an urban wind field database using CFD codes coupled with the mesoscale models. The quality and accuracy of that database determines the accuracy of the now-casting techniques. This review describes the latest advances in CFD simulations applied to urban wind and the alternatives that exist for the coupling with the mesoscale model. First, the distinct turbulence models are introduced, analyzing their advantages and limitations. Secondly, a study of the meshing is introduced, exploring how it has to be adapted to the characteristics of the urban environment. Then, the several alternatives for the definition of the boundary conditions and the interpolation methods for the initial conditions are described. As a key step, the available order reduction methods applicable to the models are presented, so the size and operability of the wind database can be reduced as much as possible. Finally, the data assimilation techniques and the model validation are presented. 2022 by the authors.;N/A
10.1016/j.ast.2022.107595;2022;Z.+Guo M.+Hao J.+Liu B.+Yu Y.+Jiang;Joint Routing And Charging Optimization For Evtol Aircraft Recovery;We study the eVTOL aircraft recovery problem (eVTOL-ARP) raised in the use cases of airport shuttles and intercity flights in Urban Air Mobility (UAM). One distinctive feature of the eVTOL-ARP is that charging tasks are allowed to be deferred and canceled. An optional charging scheme is proposed to improve recovery flexibility. Jointly handling routing and charging in an integrated manner makes the problem different from classical aircraft recovery literature and much more challenging. We formulate an integer linear program model and propose a branch-and-price algorithm to solve the eVTOL-ARP exactly. A tailored label setting algorithm that exploits the structure of the problem is proposed for the parallel pricing subproblems. Extensive experiments are conducted on the instances based on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei airport cluster and the Zhejiang Province airport cluster. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can provide efficient and timely recovery solutions in real-world operations. The recovery cost gap is over 9% between non-flexible charging and the proposed flexible charging. We conduct sensitivity analysis on a key factor, i.e. charging time that may affect the recovery cost and highlight the decreasing marginal value of the charging time. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;N/A

However, ground transportation in big urban centers has been facing challenges for many years (e.g., resilience and congestion) and new paradigms have been proposed, such as the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept. UAM aims to enhance the urban transportation system using manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing-eVTOL-vehicles). Although UAM offers many benefits (e.g., cost reduction and increase in transportation capacity), many challenges need to be faced to enable safe and efficient operations. Furthermore, trajectory planning is challenging in the National Airspace System (NAS) and UAM operations due to several factors. Finally, new initiatives concerning UAM trajectory planning can be accelerated with the support of an automatic what-if platform capable of evaluating trajectories feasibility and efficiency. This research aims to propose a simulation platform for enabling trajectory evaluation in UAM operations. This platform, named Trajectory-Based Urban Air Mobility Simulator (TUS), focuses on simulating trajectories in the urban aerial environment. TUS enables users to test new UAM algorithms (e.g., flow management strategies, real-time evaluation of maneuvers effectiveness, airspace configurations) and simulate both manned and unmanned vehicles. Furthermore, TUS operation relies on a set of inputs and evaluates the trajectories generated from efficiency and safety perspectives. This process is performed using a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) approach. The experiments performed showed that TUS can perform a realistic evaluation of UAM trajectories and can be effortlessly used to simulate hundreds of scenarios. 2000-2011 IEEE.;N/A

We used new vertiport design regulations from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for the vertiport design criteria. Vertiport components were sized based on Hyundai Motors S-A1 aircraft, and the layouts were classified as linear, satellite, and pier according to the arrangement of the TLOF pad and gate. The characteristics of each layout were analyzed for the same area. Based on these layouts, the parking space of Gimpo Airport that will be used for operating airport shuttles in the Seoul metropolitan area was measured and each layout was arranged to validate the characteristics of the layouts. Using the MATLAB program, we selected the most efficient layout among linear, satellite, and pier layouts, and estimated the TLOF pad and gate utilization rate. In addition, we evaluated the capacity of the two-story vertiport proposed by the Korea Airports Corporation for efficient use of space. 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;N/A

These particular aircraft come with different designs and are very different from traditional aircraft. An effective weight reduction method is required to enable ongoing design validation and verification. This paper presents the design of an aircraft with a high space utilization rate of the take-off and landing stage, which allows vertical take-off and landing and has long battery life. For the components fixed at the wing tips and used for installing ducted fans and based on the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, this paper puts forward two methods to carry out the lightweight design according to the stress conditions of the aircraft, namely, the manual setting the internal structure and the topology optimization. The results show that when the force on the component is small, manual setting is very effective for the purpose of weight reduction, which can also improve the manufacturability of the aircraft. 2022 by the authors.

10.1007/s10846-022-01590-8;2022;A.+E.+Garca H.+E.+Gonzlez D.+Schupke;Hybrid Route Optimisation For Maximum Air To Ground Channel Quality;The urban air mobility market is expected to grow constantly due to the increased interest in new forms of transportation. Managing aerial vehicles fleets, dependent on rising technologies such as artificial intelligence and automated ground control stations, will require a solid and uninterrupted connection to complete their trajectories. A path planner based on evolutionary algorithms to find the most suitable route has been previously proposed by the authors. Herein, we propose using particle swarm and hybrid optimisation algorithms instead of evolutionary algorithms in this work. The goal of speeding the route planning process and reducing computational costs is achieved using particle swarm and direct search algorithms. This improved path planner efficiently explores the search space and proposes a trajectory according to its predetermined goals: maximum air-to-ground quality, availability, and flight time. The proposal is tested in different situations, including diverse terrain conditions for various channel behaviours and no-fly zones. 2022, The Author(s).;N/A
10.22266/ijies2022.0630.46;2022;N.+S.+Kim;Performance Of Cellular Based Uam With Selective Comp;The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which is a power domain multiplexing technology, has received considerable attention for 5G and beyond cellular systems due to its higher spectral efficiency. Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission has been adapted in NOMA systems to improve the performance of a cell edge user. Conventional CoMP combines received signals from multiple sources using maximum ratio combining (MRC) in order to improve the user's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While MRC provides the highest diversity gain of any diversity combining technology, it requires latency for co-phasing and combining the received signals. Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has emerged as a viable option for future mobility in metropolitan areas in order to avoid terrestrial traffic congestion. However, a flight control information of a UAM, especially an unmanned UAM is very sensitive to latency. Hence MRC is not recommendable for UAM due to the inherent latency. We consider selection combining (SC) which has less latency rather than MRC as a combining technology in CoMP. This study derives the outage performance of UAM with selective CoMP in closed-form. The analytical results are compared and verified with that of the Monte Carlo simulation. The outage performances of a UAM in NOMA-NOMA and NOMA-OMA modes are compared. It is shown that the NOMA-OMA mode has better performance than the NOMA-NOMA mode irrespective of the given conditions, and has over 3 dB SNR gains under the given conditions. When the performance of UAM in the NOMA-NOMA mode is not satisfying, it is recommended to switch to the NOMA-OMA mode based on this study. 2022. All Rights Reserved.;N/A

The deployment of effective noise-reduction strategies starts with a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of noise generation. To elucidate the physics behind the onset of aerodynamic sources of sound, experimental techniques used for aerodynamic purposes have been combined with acoustic measurements. In the last decades, new experimental post-processing techniques have additionally been developed, by leveraging aeroacoustic analogies in a new multi-disciplinary framework. New approaches have been proposed with the intent of translating near-field velocity and pressure information into sound. The current review describes how such breakthroughs have been achieved, briefly starting from a historical overview, to quickly bridge to the measurement techniques and the facilities employed by the scientific community. Being the measurement principles already reported in the literature, this review only focuses on the most relevant studies trying to relate the near-field information to the perceived sound in the far-field. Aspects related to the uncertainty of the measurement techniques will be thus very briefly discussed, together with their relation to the background noise of the testing facilities, including acoustic reflections/refractions, and issues related to the instrumentation. 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.;N/A

These fan stages provide a tonal noise advantage as the blade passing frequency tone is cut-off. Contrary to conventional cut-off designs, low-count OGV (Outlet Guide Vane) designs are fan stages with fewer stator vanes than rotor blades. Low-count OGV designs benefit from lower broadband noise due to the reduced number of stator vanes. However, the blade passing frequency tone may no longer be cut-off. Therefore, we assess tonal noise reduction mechanisms for subsonic low-count OGV fan stages. We use an analytical and a numerical method to predict the rotorstator interaction noise for different blade count pairings. The results indicate that the mode phase propagation angle and the cut-on factor are two acoustic parameters that dominantly influence the noise excitation. For certain blade count pairings an acoustic benefit exists if the mode phase propagation angle is congruent to the stator leading edge angle and / or if the mode is away from the cut-off limit. Moreover, reducing the rotor tip speed allows, for some configurations, a cut-off design even with fewer stator vanes than rotor blades (inverse cut-off). Overall, the study shows promising possibilities to reduce tonal interaction noise for low-count OGV fan stages. 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS;N/A

For capturing the aircraft dynamics under motor failure conditions, a family of linearized models are obtained by trimming the nonlinear aircraft model at multiple equilibrium conditions and the LPV model is obtained by linking the linear models using the failed rotor speed, where the system transition from healthy to failure is modeled by a scheduling parameter calculated based on failed rotor speed caused by available motor peak power after failure. The proposed adaptive MPC is developed to optimize the system output performance, including the rigid-body aircraft velocity and altitude, by using quadratic programming optimization with reference compensation subject to a set of time-varying constraints representing the current available propeller acceleration calculated based on the motor power. Simulation study is conducted based on the developed LPV control design and original nonlinear rigid-body model, and the simulation results demonstrate that the designed adaptive MPC controller is able to recover and maintain the aircraft at desired stable condition after motor failure.

This implies a low cost, high speed air-to-ground data pipe is available, which leads to the concept of Digital Twin to be leveraged to optimize the operation and maintenance.

Many tasks are currently carried out in metropolitan areas, such as urban traffic monitoring, pollution and land monitoring, security surveillance, delivery of small packages, etc. Estimation of features around the flight path and surveillance of crowded areas, where there is a high number of vehicles and/or obstacles, are of extreme importance for typical UAS missions. Ensuring safety and efficiency during air traffic operations in a metropolitan area is one of the conditions for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations. This paper focuses on the development of a ground control system capable of monitoring crowded areas or impervious sites, identifying the UAV position and a safety area for vertical landing or take-off maneuvers (VTOL), ensuring a high level of accuracy and robustness, even without using GNSS-derived navigation information, and with on-board terrain hazard detection and avoidance (DAA) capabilities, in particular during operations conducted in BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line Of Sight). The system is composed by a mechanically rotating real-time LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor, linked to a Raspberry Pi 3 as SBC (Session Board Controller), and interfaced to a GCS (Ground Control Station) by wireless connection for data management and 3-D information transfer. 2022 by the authors.

UAMs are based on eco-friendly electric propulsive systems to enhance mobility and maximize the use of three-dimensional airspace. However, UAM aircraft are very vulnerable to lightning strikes due to their relatively small size and flight characteristics, flying close to the ground. To tackle this problem, the present study developed a lightning zoning method for UAM aircraft with complex configurations and investigated the direct effects of lightning strikes on the prop-rotor blade of a UAM aircraft. First, computational simulation models for zoning analysis were developed for four representative UAM aircraft (one wingless multi-copter, one winged lift/cruise, and two winged vectored thrust types). The lightning zoning analysis identified the prop-rotor blade tips as Zone 1A, which has a high probability of initial lightning attachment. The direct effects of lightning strikes on a prop-rotor blade made of woven carbon/epoxy laminate were then investigated using both experimental and numerical methods. In general, the damage pattern of the simulation results agreed fairly well with the damage pattern in the experimental results. Moreover, it was shown that the prop-rotor blade of a relatively small UAM aircraft can suffer more damage, even after being struck by the lightning of the same intensity. In the future, since batteries, electric motors, inverters, and hydrogen fuel tanks, which are required by the new propulsion systems in UAM aircraft, will be increasingly used, designing a lightning protection system that properly reflects these changes will emerge as an important issue. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;N/A

Such vehicles feature a hybrid configuration with tiltrotors and fixed wings, enabling vertical takeoff/landing capability while attaining level flight range and endurance. A comprehensive nonlinear rigid-body dynamic model is developed by incorporating multiple tiltrotor dynamics and their gyroscopic and inertial coupling effects. A quasi-steady aerodynamic formulation is used to derive the aerodynamic loads on all lifting surfaces. In addition to the conventional control surfaces of the fixed-wing aircraft, the tiltrotor angular positions and rotational speeds are also considered additional control inputs in the derivation of nonlinear flight dynamic equations. These nonlinear equations are then linearized with respect to a set of trimmed conditions to generate the corresponding linear time-invariant state-space models, which are best suited for flight control design. In particular, to capture the critical dynamical behaviors during the transition from vertical to forward flight, the linear models are attained at various angular positions of the tiltrotors. These linear models are then utilized to develop a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model in which the tiltrotor angular position is considered the scheduling parameter. Subsequently, the adaptive model predictive control (MPC) methodology is used to design the flight controllers to achieve a stable and smooth transition flight. The numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed modeling and control approach. 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS;N/A

The data resulting from the survey include several aspects of public perceptions towards flying cars, as for example: willingness to use and pay for flying cars, willingness to use and pay for flying taxi services, perceptions towards potential benefits and concerns arising from the future use of flying cars, perceptions towards considering residence relocation, and perceptions towards potential security measures to improve operational safety of flying cars. In addition, information relating to several dimensions of driving and travel behaviours and habits, and socio-demographic information of the participants were also collected. The dataset can be used as a baseline to design future surveys on Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and flying cars, and to compare consumer perceptions across different regions and during different time periods. 2022;N/A

10.3390/drones6030070;2022;S.+De M.+Pagliarani F.+Tomasello D.+Trojaniello A.+Sanna;Design Of A Service For Hospital Internal Transport Of Urgent Pharmaceuticals Via Drones;The internal transport of medical goods in a hospital heavily relies on human resources that carry the materials on foot. Such mode of transport may be affected by inefficiencies, e.g., due to bottlenecks, and other logistic challenges. Thus, it may benefit from the use of unmanned aircraft systems in several aspects. Such a scenario introduces specific criticalities for healthcare organizations in densely populated areas and below congested airspace, such as the Milan metropolitan area. The authors applied a co-creation methodology to design a highly automated drone service for the delivery of pharmaceuticals at San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. The needs of the main users were identified by means of semi-structured interviews and visualization material. Based on those outcomes, a drone service was designed and validated with the main users. It emerged that the main gain point of such a service would be increasing hospital logistics efficiency. The risks tied to the operations (e.g., tampering of the delivery container) were evaluated and appropriate mitigations were identified (e.g., use of tamper-evident seals or mechatronic locks). The information required by the digital system offering the needed logistics functions was analyzed for future development. Recent conceptual and regulatory advancements in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) in Europe were elaborated to outline the digital ecosystem in which aviation and non-aviation actors would exchange information to ensure operations efficiency, safety and regulatory compliance. 2022 by the authors.

10.20965/ijat.2022.p0183;2022;Y.+Mihara T.+Nakamura A.+Nakamoto M.+Nakano;Airframe Design Optimization And Simulation Of A Flying Car For Medical Emergencies;In terms of future transportation, flying cars are envisioned not only as air taxis but also as air ambulances. Flying cars such as urban air mobility vehicles, passenger drones, and electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircrafts have the potential to relieve seriously congested ground traffic in cities via direct point-to-point air movements. To date, conventional research in which the airframe of a flying car is optimized for use in medical emergencies has not identified a sustainable solution. The purpose of this study is to verify the technical applicability of a flying car for use in medical emergencies. The weighted sum method is used to optimize the design of multi-rotor, vectored-thrust (tilt-rotor), and lift + cruise types of flying cars. A simulation scenario that considers cruising speed and flight height is conducted based on an analysis of stakeholder interviews with a pilot, an inflight doctor, and an operating company. To optimize the parameters of a flying car airframe, four objective functions, namely the energy required for a round trip, noise value from rotors, downwash speed from rotors, and landing area size, are chosen because the results of a requirement analysis revealed that they were significant for the sustainability of the flying car system. The results of the simulation reveal that the required battery energy densities for all three types exceed the current lithium-ion battery capacities. Therefore, an upgrade in battery capacity is critical for the realization of a flying car. Although the noise level is found to be less than that of a conventional helicopter, it is necessary to develop a rotor to decrease noise levels for environmental reasons. Finally, both the downwash speed and landing area of a flying car are estimated to be less than those of a conventional helicopter, making it possible for the flying car to land in tight spaces.

Additive manufacturing technologies can be leveraged to produce engineered three-dimensional electrode structures with increased electrolyte/electrode interfacial area and high density, yielding increased power and energy densities. In this work, a novel engineered three-dimensional interdigitated LiFePO4 cathode structure was designed and manufactured using direct-write additive manufacturing technology, which allowed for the deposition of highly solid-loaded inks with excellent dimensional accuracy. Ink rheology was adjusted to optimize material characteristics of the final electrodes, including the addition of carbon nanoparticles to increase the final electrode conductivity. Printed cathodes were then sintered and characterized. The sintered electrodes possessed greater structural stability and a surface area approximately 190% greater than similarly produced devices reported in the literature. Finally, the characterization of the manufactured electrodes showed uniform dispersion of conductive carbon nanopowder throughout the microstructure, which could increase the final conductivity of the electrodes. 2021 American Ceramics Society.

10.3390/drones6020028;2022;E.+etin A.+Cano R.+Deransy S.+Tres C.+Barrado;Implementing Mitigations For Improving Societal Acceptance Of Urban Air Mobility;The continuous development of technical innovations provides the opportunity to create new economic markets and a wealth of new services. However, these innovations sometimes raise concerns, notably in terms of societal, safety, and environmental impacts. This is the case for services related to the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which are emerging rapidly. Unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones, date back to the first third of the twentieth century in aviation industry, when they were mostly used for military purposes. Nowadays, drones of various types and sizes are used for many purposes, such as precision agriculture, search and rescue missions, aerial photography, shipping and delivery, etc. Starting to operate in areas with low population density, drones are now looking for business in urban and suburban areas, in what is called urban air mobility (UAM). However, this rapid growth of the drone industry creates psychological fear of the unknown in some parts of society. Reducing this fear will play an important role in public acceptance of drone operations in urban areas. This paper presents the main concerns of society with regard to drone operations, as already captured in some public surveys, and proposes a list of mitigation measures to reduce these concerns. The proposed list is then analyzed, and its applicability to individual, urban, very large demonstration flights is explained, using the feedback from the CORUS-XUAM project. CORUS-XUAM will organize a set of very large drone flight demonstrations across seven European countries to investigate how to safely integrate drone operations into airspace with the support of the U-space. 2022 by the authors.

10.3390/app12031183;2022;R.+Goyal A.+Cohen;Advanced Air Mobility: Opportunities And Challenges Deploying Evtols For Air Ambulance Service;Advanced air mobility (AAM) is a broad concept enabling consumers access to on-demand air mobility, cargo and package delivery, healthcare applications, and emergency services through an integrated and connected multimodal transportation network. While a number of technical and social concerns have been raised about AAM, early use cases for emergency response and aeromedical transport may be key to demonstrating the concept and building public acceptance. Using a five-step multi-method approach consisting of preliminary scoping, modeling performance metrics, developing baseline assumptions, analyzing scenarios, and applying a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, this study examines the potential operational and market viability of the air ambulance market using a variety of aircraft and propulsion types. The analysis concludes that electric vertical take-off and land (eVTOL) aircraft could confront a number of operational and economic challenges for aeromedical applications compared to hybrid vertical take-off and land (VTOL) aircraft and rotorcraft. The study finds that technological improvements such as reduced charge times, increased operational range, and battery swapping could make the eVTOL aircraft more reliable and cost-effective for aeromedical transport. 2022 by the authors.

10.1016/j.cor.2021.105611;2022;H.+Shin T.+Lee H.+R.+Lee;Skyport Location Problem For Urban Air Mobility System;With rapid advancement in aerial vehicle technologies, air taxi is drawing keen interest as a new type of transportation service. One of the necessary elements for air taxi-based transportation service system is a skyport, which is a designated area for take-off and landing of air taxis. In planning a skyport network for air taxi transportation system, it is important to consider midair congestion between air taxis. Severe congestion increases the risk of collisions, which in turn increases the complexity in scheduling and routing in the subsequent operations phase. In this study, we propose a novel hub location problem (HLP) that incorporates traffic congestion caused by intersecting vehicles along hub-to-hub arcs. Modeling congestion in an HLP formulation involves nonconvex bilinear terms, which makes it difficult to solve. We tackle this challenge by exploiting a property of an optimal solution and reformulating the original model to obtain a linear formulation. We also develop a heuristic algorithm based on a genetic algorithm to handle large-size problems for practical applications. Using the proposed model and solution methods, extensive experiments have been conducted to study optimal design of air taxi network under various environments. Our analyses demonstrate that viability of air taxi service is a complicated function of many factors including collision risk, system cost, airspace design, to name a few. Our model can offer quantitative understanding of such complex relationships to assess and develop strategies to improve the viability of an air taxi transportation system. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;N/A
10.13052/jmm1550-4646.19116;2022;M.+A.+Salvador;Challenges Of Machine Learning For Evtol Reliability And Safety;The increasing number of requests for type certification received by the European Union Safety Agency on Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft attests to the expansion of frontiers in Urban Air Mobility (UAM). In addition, it has revealed the interest of traditional airplane and helicopter manufacturers in this new technology, all the while highlighting the emergence of new players developing their respective versions of electric-powered VTOLs (eVTOL). The perspective of eVTOLs going into service in the coming years for the transport of passengers raises new safety concerns. Indeed, it is necessary to ensure the reliability and safety aspects of those aircraft systems that will be flying under new operational missions, differing from current fixed wing (airplanes) and rotorcraft (helicopters) aircraft. At the same time, the evolution of aircraft systems monitoring technology is making it possible to acquire increasing amounts of data. The high complexity of new systems, combined with the huge amount of data provided, can make the decision-making process more difficult for pilots. Machine learning makes it possible to evaluate this data and improve reliability and safety. Even as the number of aeronautical accidents has decreased over the last years, 6080% of those accidents are the result of human failure. In the initial implementation and operation stages of eVTOLs, machine learning (ML) can support pilots by using aircraft data to predict system failures and contribute to improve reliability and safety. Then, at an advanced stage of eVTOL operation, ML may help reduce human interaction with the aircraft, paving the way toward fully autonomous aircraft. The association of ML with technologies such as Digital Twins and 6G networks has the potential to enable safe and reliable autonomous flight. However, the introduction of eVTOLs will also increase air traffic in highly populated areas and thus needs to be studied to support the incorporation of the future autonomous aircraft. This paper addresses the main challenges for the incorporation of ML in the upcoming eVTOL fleet and its potential contribution to aircraft systems reliability and safety. It also explores the need for the use of ML techniques in a more autonomous air traffic management systems the face of increased air traffic. 2022 River Publishers.;N/A

For a given specific energy of the power source, the cruise endurance can be approximately doubled by using structural power composites as opposed to conventional batteries. Replacing all the eligible composite mass and batteries with structural power composites can reduce the CityAirbus weight by 25%. To achieve the current design performance, the minimum required elastic modulus, strength, specific energy and power for the structural power composite are 54GPa, 203MPa, 74 Wh/kg and 376W/kg, respectively: current state-of-the-art structural power composites are now approaching this level of performance. Hence, structural power composites are considered feasible for adoption in the urban air mobility sector and have the potential to improve endurance and facilitate commercialization. This paper also discusses several key challenges that must be addressed to realize the adoption of structural power composites in future electric air taxis. The Author(s) 2022.;N/A
N/A;2022;D.+Shirazi;Comparison Of The Charm Predictions Of The Multirotor Test Bed With Wind Tunnel Experimental Results;Urban air mobility as a fast transportation solution has captured the attention of private companies and government aviation departments in the 21st century. New designs of aerial vehicles are being developed to meet industry needs but often neglect the aerodynamic characteristics and the effects of interacting rotors. This work focuses on predicting rotor behavior and understanding the importance of the rotor wake interaction for future urban air mobility (UAM) designs. The Multirotor Test Bed (MTB) project was initiated at NASA Ames Research center to support the NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Project to study rotorcraft performance specifically for multirotor aircraft. The MTB is a modular multirotor test stand that makes testing feasible for up to six rotors at different angles and rotor arrangements, including Tall and Short configurations at different horizontal and vertical rotor separation distances. The MTB was tested in the U.S Armys 7- by 10-Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center in late 2019. This work focuses on exploring the impact of aerodynamic interactions between the MTB rotors using the Comprehensive Hierarchical Aeromechanics Rotorcraft Model (CHARM) software. The CHARM software is capable of modeling Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft aerodynamics in maneuvering and steady flight conditions. CHARM allows the user to define flow and body characteristics, including the rotor geometry, aerodynamic conditions, wind tunnel speed, and airfoil tables as inputs. As the first step, a single MTB rotor was simulated in hover, and the results were compared with wind tunnel test data to confirm the CHARM parameters. Once the accurate performance was verified, the MTB rotors were simulated in forward flight, and each rotor was trimmed to the measured thrust. The simulation variables include one, two, four, and six rotors at the Short and Tall configurations, with MTB pitch angles of 0, -5, and -10 degrees. The MTB was simulated with and without wind tunnel walls. These results demonstrate the rotor wake interaction and its impact on rotor performance. This information also helps determine which configurations should be explored for future wind tunnel tests. Copyright 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;N/A
N/A;2022;M.+Radotich;Conceptual Design Of Tiltrotor Aircraft For Urban Air Mobility;There has been an abundance of new and novel aircraft designs created for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) in recent years. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contributes to the research and development of this industry in part by applying its aircraft design tools to create conceptual designs of UAM reference vehicles. The vehicles are intended to quantify the tradeoffs and performance capabilities necessary for VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft in the UAM design space. The reference vehicles represent a variety of configurations that seek to encompass many of the design characteristics suitable for UAM. This work focuses on the conceptual design process of two new NASA reference vehicles. Both aircraft are configured as conventional tiltrotors, but one is powered by turboshaft engines, and one is fully electric. The sizing and performance of the two aircraft are discussed, as well as how the performance and characteristics compare to a selection of other NASA reference vehicles. It is found that the tiltrotor configuration is capable of reaching speeds 43% to 51% faster than the other turboshaft designs, and 54% to 93% faster than the other electric designs. The increased speed leads to a 24% to 42% decrease in overall mission time. Copyright 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;N/A
N/A;2022;D.+Jayasundara J.+Baeder;Aeroacoustic Analysis Of Non-Periodic Propeller Motions;The future of urban air mobility (UAM) highly depends on the ability to design electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft with lower noise emissions. eVTOLs need to be quieter not only during steady flight but also during transient maneuvers such as take-off and landing, propeller rotational speed variations, and transitions between hover and forward flight modes. Propeller aeroacoustic studies have heavily depended upon experiments and low fidelity numerical frameworks. Wind tunnel and flight testing are expensive and time-consuming. Numerical schemes based on low-fidelity aerodynamic solvers such as blade element momentum theory or other modeling methods may not adequately account for the complex aerodynamics of the transient maneuvers. Therefore, this study attempts to create a more robust high-fidelity framework to simulate the aeroacoustics of propellers that undergo unsteady non-periodic maneuvers by coupling a Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings solver with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Furthermore, it uses the framework to study propeller transition from hover to forward flight, while reducing the rotational speed. The results obtained from the unsteady simulation are compared with those obtained from quasi-steady simulations at intermediate steps of the transition. A tilting quasi-steady simulation is performed at the halfway point to more closely approximate the unsteady simulation. Copyright 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;N/A
N/A;2022;L.+Weist N.+Schatzman;Rabbit: A Rapid Low Fidelity Bvi Prediction Tool  Comparison And Validation Using The Nasa Rvlt Toolchain;Rotorcraft noise source identification is at the forefront of civil rotorcraft applications with the emergence of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) market. Blade Vortex Interaction (BVI) has been identified as one key source of noise produced by a rotor. To predict BVI occurrences for various Urban Air Mobility (UAM) configurations, the RApid Blade and Blade-Vortex InTeraction (RABBIT) tool was developed and utilized. The tool is built from a Beddoes Wake Model, and computes variables such as miss distance and BVI angle to calculate an impulse factor, which is able to visualize BVI for a given vehicle and flight condition. A complete checkout of this tool and comparison with CAMRADII and ANOPP2/AARON, is performed. A wake comparison between RABBIT and CAMRADII is presented, and BVI is compared with ANOPP2/AARONs acoustic pressure time history to verify the tools effectiveness and accuracy. Three NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) concept vehicles were analyzed with increasing geometric and aerodynamic complexity, including the Quiet Single Main Rotor (QSMR), Side-by-Side, and Quadrotor. An analysis of the results concludes that RABBIT presents a low-fidelity tool that accurately predicts BVI location and intensity for multiple vehicle configurations and various flight conditions.

N/A;2022;S.+J.+Wright;Aeroelastic Analysis Of An Urban Air Mobility Rotor In Forward Edgewise Flight;Urban Air Mobility vehicle concepts represent a new type of vertical lift machine. From the use of multirotor configurations to the use of variable RPM for thrust control of rigid, propeller-style rotors, many of the UAM concepts observed in industry have departed significantly from traditional VTOL designs. While such novel vehicle types may provide beneficial mission capability and efficiency, they have not been as thoroughly studied as more traditional configurations, and new aeromechanics analysis must be conducted. Operating states such as low-tip-speed rotors in edgewise flight may prove to yield unusual aeroelastic behavior and must be investigated. In the present work, a rotorcraft comprehensive analysis is used to analyze the aeroelastic characteristics of a fixed-pitch, variable RPM rotor in edgewise flight. The rotor model, a three-bladed, fixed pitch propeller, was developed in a previous work. Floquet theory analysis is used to capture the periodic nature of the dynamics. Parameters such as rotor rotational speed, forward flight speed, and blade torsion stiffness are varied and their impact on performance and stability are assessed. A value of torsion stiffness is identified to yield stable flight from 0-100 kts with a wide range of RPM values. The results may be used to provide insight into the aeroelastic characteristics of certain UAM-type rotors. Copyright 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;N/A
N/A;2022;A.+Karon M.+Mayo;Rotor-Rotor Interaction Effects On Noise From A Tandem Rotor Configuration;Multi-rotor configurations are commonly employed when developing drones as well as Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Understanding the noise generated by these multi-rotor configurations is critical to designing quieter aircraft that will be accepted by the communities they operate in. Additionally, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Aero-Acoustic (CAA) codes, which aid in the design of these novel aircraft, have typically not been validated for these complex configurations due to lack of experimental data. This study is focused on the collection and analysis of acoustic and performance data for a tandem rotor configuration. The collected data sheds light on the effect of rotor-rotor interaction on total noise generation and can be used for CFD/CAA validation. A key result fromthis study is that the tandemrotor configuration creates a time varying oscillation effect on SPLs at the generated tones, particularly the BPF. It is also shown that for counter-rotating rotor pairs, the noise increases are directed in the rearward direction, while for the co -rotating rotors, the noise increases independent of direction. Additionally, the spacing of rotors is more important in the rearward direction for counter-rotating rotors. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;N/A

Various configurations of AAM platforms are constantly being proposed, but the majority of them are based on a multi-rotor system consisting of single or coaxial rotors. This work summarizes a CFD model development using a hybrid BEMT and unsteady RANS flow solver, Rotorcraft CFD, which predicts rotor performance at a fidelity suitable for engineering design in a fraction of the time required by conventional CFD methods. Single and coaxial rotor configurations are presented using two-bladed KDE 30.5 rotors and are compared to test data obtained in the NASA Langley 14- by 22- ft. Subsonic Tunnel Facility. The simulations were run with both fully-turbulent and free-transition airfoil performance tables to quantify the associated uncertainty.

N/A;2022;N.+J.+Peters C.+Silva J.+Ekaterinaris;A Data-Driven Reduced Order Model Of An Isolated Rotor;There are numerous conceptual design stage rotorcraft analysis tasks which demand a high-fidelity and low cost method for rotor load distribution predictions. Considering Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles aim to operate in close proximity to buildings and with unique rotor configurations, there is a significant challenge in quickly and accurately modeling rotors operating in complex, turbulent flow fields. One potential path for deriving a high-fidelity, low cost rotor model is with data-driven surrogate modeling. In this study, an initial investigation is taken to apply a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced order model (ROM) for the purpose of pressure distribution prediction. In this study, a POD ROM was derived to produce distributed pressure predictions on rotor blades subjected to topology change due to variation in twist and taper ratio. Rotor twist was varied between 0, 10, 20, and 30 while taper ratio was varied between 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7. All rotors consisted of a single blade. The POD ROM was validated for three demonstration cases, a high thrust rotor in hover, a low thrust rotor in hover, and a rotor in forward flight with a flight speed of M = 0.1. Results showed highly accurate distributed load predictions could be achieved at minimal computational cost. Computational cost for hovering blade surface pressure modeling was reduced from 12 hours on 440 cores to 105 seconds on a single core. For blade in forward flight cost was reduced from 20 hours on 440 cores to 0.6 seconds on a single core. For cases of high thrust and low thrust rotors, POD ROM was used to undergo a design optimization of the rotor such that figure of merit was maximized. Total optimization time for each case was 1 minute. Copyright 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;N/A

The VMS provides a unique capability to reduce risk by assessing and iterating control designs. Minimal sources currently exist to provide performance and handling qualities data for large, rotor speed-controlled vehicles outside of the software environment.

Additionally, both ADS-33 and a tailored set of performance standards (notionally representing the agility required of a UAM mission) are examined under conditions with and without light turbulence. Preliminary results did show significant variation in ratings based on the set of standards utilized, controller tuning to either Level 1 or boundary Level 1/ Level 2 conditions, and presence or lack of turbulence.

This study demonstrates a numerical prediction of the rolling tire noises considering tread composite material models in the coupled acoustic-structural finite element analysis. The viscoelastic master curves were developed for the frequency-dependent damping in the structural vibrations of the tire. It was numerically found that the tread composites with 230.4% and 1,428% larger storage (E) and loss moduli (E), respectively, resulted in 1.169.79% louder structure-borne noises. Moreover, the elastic modulus (E) of the tread composites was proportionally related to the tire noises, suggesting that reduced elastic and viscoelastic moduli are desired for low-noise tires. This study can contribute to thoroughly understanding how the composite material properties, particularly viscoelasticity, can be designed to control structural noise and vibration in next-generation structures such as autonomous electric vehicles and urban air mobility. 2022 Japan Society for Composite Materials, Korean Society for Composite Materials and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;N/A

Ignoring the existence of intra-respondent preference heterogeneity could bias preference elicitation and demand forecast. Thus far, most studies covering inter- and intra-respondent preference heterogeneity have applied the mixed multinomial logit model. Meanwhile, the behavioural explanations for such preference variations remain under-explored. This paper accommodates inter- and intra-respondent preference heterogeneity through a two-layer latent class modelling structure, where the continuous random distributions are replaced with discrete mixtures in both layers. A latent variable representing variety-seeking is included to explain class membership probabilities, offering additional behavioural insights concerning the source of preference heterogeneity both across and within respondents. Two aspects associated with variety-seeking are examined: novelty-seeking (i.e. the inclination to adopt new modes) and alternation (i.e. the tendency to vary ones behaviour regularly by selecting different modes continuously). In the context of new shared mobility, this paper finds the role of both aspects in preference heterogeneity. Specifically, novelty seekers are found to be more likely to fall into the class with higher probabilities of switching from existing modes to the new air taxi service than novelty avoiders, and alternation seekers are more likely to belong to the class with higher probabilities to exhibit intra-respondent preference heterogeneity than alternation avoiders. This paper, therefore, provides empirical evidence to identify the target customers of the new air taxi service. 2022, The Author(s).;N/A

10.1007/978-3-031-15444-7_9;2022;J.+Slma P.+Va J.+Faigl;Gng-Based Clustering OfRisk-Aware Trajectories IntoSafe Corridors;Personal air transportation on short distances is a promising trend in modern aviation, raising new challenges as flying in low altitudes in highly populated environments induces additional risk to people and properties on the ground. Risk-aware planning can mitigate the risk by preferring flying above low-risk areas such as rivers or brownfields. Finding such trajectories is computationally demanding, but they can be precomputed for areas that are not changing rapidly and form a planning roadmap. The roadmap can be utilized for multi-query trajectory planning using graph-based search. However, a quality roadmap is required to provide a low-risk trajectory for an arbitrary query on arisk-aware trajectory from one location to another. Even though a dense roadmap can achieve the quality, it would be computationally demanding. Therefore, we propose to cluster the found trajectories and create a sparse roadmap of safe corridors that provide similar quality of risk-aware trajectories. In this paper, we report on applying Growing Neural Gas (GNG) in estimating the suitable number of clusters. Based on the empirical evaluation using a realistic urban scenario, the results suggest a significant reduction of the computational burden on risk-aware trajectory planning using the roadmap with the clustered safe corridors. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;N/A

10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3201962;2022;J.+Hu X.+Yang W.+Wang P.+Wei L.+Ying Y.+Liu;Obstacle Avoidance For Uas In Continuous Action Space Using Deep Reinforcement Learning;Obstacle avoidance for small unmanned aircraft is vital for the safety of future urban air mobility (UAM) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM). There are a variety of techniques for real-time robust drone guidance, but numerous of them solve in discretized airspace and control, which would require an additional path smoothing step to provide flexible commands for UAS. To deliver safe and computationally efficient guidance for UAS operations, we explore the use of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to lead autonomous UAS to their destinations while bypassing obstacles through continuous control. The proposed scenario state representation and reward function can map the continuous state space to continuous control for both heading angle and speed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework, we conducted numerical experiments with static and moving obstacles. Uncertainties associated with the environments and safety operation bounds are investigated in detail. Results show that the proposed model is able to provide accurate and robust guidance and resolve conflict with a success rate of over 99%. 2013 IEEE.;N/A

Successful pilot intervention will be especially important for handling emergency procedures. This paper demonstrates the use of human-centric flight guidance concepts to mitigate the effects of non-catastrophic failures in future VTOL UAM aircraft. Specifically, a single failure in the lateral steering function of an automatic flight control system is considered. A new waypoint guidance law is proposed to generate the required roll command to manually steer the aircraft toward a predefined safe landing zone. Two display concepts are proposed to aid the manual execution of the roll steering command: a head-down display (HDD), and a head-mounted display (HMD). The guidance law and the display concepts were integrated into a high-fidelity, wide field-of-view rotorcraft simulation environment. Human-in-the-loop experiments were performed with non-pilot test subjects. The effectiveness of the guidance law and display concepts along with the associated piloting performance and human factor impacts were assessed. The results indicated that all test subjects were able to reach a close vicinity of the final waypoint. The HMD induced lower workload whereas the HDD resulted in better tracking performance.

In near future, UAVs are expected to be used in package delivery service and larger electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles will be employed for urban air mobility applications (air taxi). Thus, several electric propulsion systems will enter the low-altitude airspace with frequent take offs and landings. To achieve state-of-the-art safety standards under such high traffic density, UAVs will require in-time fault detection and performance monitoring of critical powertrain components. This work focuses on propeller blade performance and damage detection in electric UAVs. Propellers are the fastest moving component in an UAV, even a minor defect in the propeller blades could cause performance deterioration, with consequent challenges in flying through the planned trajectory or adhere to the safety requirements of the operation. Monitoring and updating aerodynamic efficiency of each rotor would therefore enable the detection of off-nominal propeller conditions thus magnifying the state-awareness of powertrain monitoring systems based on the acquired electrical signals. An extended Kalman filter-based parameter estimation algorithm is being implemented that incorporates time history responses from UAV powertrain in conjunction with a full powertrain system model to identify changes in the propeller aerodynamic efficiency. Propeller fault detection is achieved by incorporating the aerodynamic parameters of the propeller into the powertrain model. The proposed technique is successfully validated with numerical simulations. 2022 IEEE.;N/A
10.4337/9781800375611.00017;2022;U.+A.+Tuncer;Digitalization In Urban Mobility: An Assessment Through The Iglus Framework;Over the last century, urban transport studies have traditionally focused on private cars, public transport, and their infrastructures. In the past few decades, there has been a paradigm shift and the concept of mobility has come to the forefront. This approach is more comprehensive, as it includes walking, cycling, new paratransit modes such as e-scooters and, again, their infrastructures. On the other hand, as in other urban infrastructures and services, there is a pervasive digitalization in urban mobility. Electric and urban air mobility, autonomous vehicles, shared services, and platformization are some of the popular topics that are now addressed widely in related literature. In this chapter, we focus on these new technologies and developments in urban mobility and analyze their implications for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience, making use of the IGLUS conceptualization, which is based on a systems approach. Therefore, the interdependence between new mobility and other urban infrastructures and potential scenarios for overall future urban context is also studied. Without a specific country, city, or context, there is a global angle and findings from related literature are synthesized to conduct an analysis. Matthias Finger and Numan Yanar 2022.

There is a need for accurate and timely positioning in safety-critical automotive and aerial applications, such as advanced warning systems or in urban air mobility (UAM). Today, these high-accuracy demands can partially be satisfied by GNSS, though not in dense urban conditions or under GNSS threats (e.g. interference, jamming or spoofing). Temporary and on-demand 5G network deployments using ground and flying base stations (BSs) are indeed a novel solution to exploit hybrid GNSS, 5G and sensor algorithms for the provision of accurate three-dimensional (3D) position and motion information, especially for challenging urban and suburban scenarios. Thus, this paper first analyzes the positioning technologies available, including signals, positioning methods, algorithms and architectures. Then, design considerations of 5G overlay networks are discussed, by including simulation results on the 5G signal bandwidth, antenna array and network deployment. 2022 IEEE.;N/A
10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.07.277;2022;Q.+Wei G.+Nilsson S.+Coogan;Safety Verification For Urban Air Mobility Scheduling;In Urban Air Mobility (UAM) networks, takeoff and landing sites, called vertiports, are likely to experience intermittent closures due to, e.g., adverse weather. For safety, it will be required that all in-Transit Urban Air Vehicles (UAVs) in a UAM network have alternative landing sites in the event of a vertiport closure. In this paper, we propose analytical conditions for developing an efficient algorithm that, given a proposed UAM schedule, verifies whether all UAVs are able to safely reach a back-up landing site in the event of a vertiport closure without violating the limited landing capacity of each vertiport in the network. If safety verification is not possible, the algorithm returns a counterexample demonstrating the violation. Our solution allows for uncertain travel time between UAM vertiports and scales quadratically with the number of scheduled UAVs. We demonstrate our algorithm on a UAM network with up to 1,000 UAVs. 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.;N/A

One of the challenges for these eVTOL vehicles will be the complexity of the flight control task which requires operation in hover, forward flight and the transition between the two. The trim envelope is an important piece of information for analyzing which airspeeds and either flight path angles or vertical speeds are safely achievable in each flight regime. The largest share of the vehicle concept designs for UAM are some kind of vectored thrust vehicle, highlighting the importance of analyzing these flight regime transitions. This papercalculates and compares the trim envelopes for a generic tiltrotor aircraft model for different rotor tilt angles. Preliminary results confirm a narrow transition corridor that is a well-known characteristic of tiltrotor aircraft. 2022 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.;N/A

A series of analytical processes for vertiport design, demand prediction, and performance analysis is presented. To design the vertiport layout, we propose a novel algorithm that evaluates the surrounding obstacles by considering current regulations. The potential demand for air taxi services by urban air mobility (UAM) as multimodal transportation is predicted by a discrete choice model that estimates the probability of choosing an air taxi service given the time saving of UAM. Then, the sensitivity of demand was analyzed for the catchment area, travel cost, and the number of passengers on board. The sensitivity analysis showed that the demand for UAM was sensitive to all factors considered. Vertiport performance is evaluated by comparing the expected number of operations derived from the UAM demand to the vertiport capacity. The proposed methodology was applied to a vertiport in the Seoul metropolitan area for the initial UAM operations. The results show that having one less gate significantly increases the waiting time of the UAM when the utilization factor of the waiting queue is high. However, the average waiting time is less than 20 min (the maximum hover time of eVTOL vehicles) if the vertiport has a sufficient number of gates, depending on the traffic volume of UAM. Therefore, it is essential to determine the number of gates considering the expected traffic volume to ensure safe UAM operations. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.;N/A
N/A;2022;S.+L.+Jones D.+Barazanchy J.+Widawsky W.+De;Manufacturing Process Considerations When Transitioning From Thermoset To Thermoplastic Composite Material For Urban Air Mobility Propellers;Thermoset (TS) and thermoplastic (TP) composites can both be found on aerospace structures, yet the use of TS composites on primary structures vastly exceeds the use of TP composites. In part, this may be attributed to the processing methods of the two fiber-reinforced polymers, as greater processing temperatures needed to cure TP composites when compared to TS composite manufacturing. The thermal formability of TP composites opens the door to fastener-free assemblies which has the benefit of reducing weight without compromising joint strength or requiring extensive co-curing. TP structures also offer a more rapid consolidation, allowing high-rate manufacturing, as needed by the urban air mobility market (UAM). To further explore and contrast applicable manufacturing methods of both material systems, a manufacturing demonstrator concept was designed. A generic propeller blade model was used as the reference structure for this research. This particular propeller blade model was originally designed for TS composite manufacturing. Alternative manufacturing methods were explored to produce the same propeller blade using TP composite materials and processes. The result is a road map for design for manufacturing of TP composite structures when converting from TS composites. Copyright 2022 by the authors and the University of South Carolina.;N/A

TPCs offer high toughness, potential for rapid cycle times, and can be joined into fastener-free assemblies. One promising joining method, induction welding, uses electromagnetic fields to induce heating in TPC laminates stemming from electrically conductive carbon fibers. However, current induction welding heats up the entire laminates during joining, requiring heat sinks and complicated thermal management that increases cycle time and leads to complex crystallization behavior that varies throughout the laminate thickness. Herein, electrically conductive poly (ether ketone ketone) (PEKK)/ graphene nanocomposites are evaluated for their potential as susceptors for rapid heating. Induction heating experiments on PEKK/graphene are performed at 288 KHz and PEKK/graphene heating rates are analyzed using a thermal imaging camera.

Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) is a high-performance thermoplastic polymer with desirable crystallization times, low melt viscosity, and high degree of crystallinity, however, thermal aging of PPS increases the zero-shear viscosity, retarding melt processing. PPS laminates are readily joined by induction welding processing wherein joining rates are proportional to material melt temperatures and crystallization profiles. For all the positives of PPS, the impacts of thermal aging of the matrix on induction welding efficiency and bond strength are not understood. This work examines the interdependencies of degree of thermal ageing of PPS, crystallization behavior as a function of processing temperature/time, and melt viscoelastic properties of PPS. Differential scanning calorimetry and frequency-dependent rheology were applied to correlate melt-state anneal time to degree of crystallinity and complex viscosity. Copyright 2022 by Jeffrey S.

This paper addresses the strategic conflict issue in low-altitude UAM operations with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Considering the difference in flight characteristics, the aircraft performance is fully integrated into the design process of strategic deconfliction components. With this concept, the multi-resolution structure for the low-altitude airspace organization, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for the speed profile generation, and dynamic separation minima enable efficient UAM operations. To resolve the demand and capacity balancing (DCB) issue and the separation conflict at the strategic stage, the multi-agent asynchronous advantage actor-critic (MAA3C) framework is built with mask recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Meanwhile, variable agent number, dynamic environments, heterogeneous aircraft performance, and action selection between speed adjustment and ground delay can be well handled. Experiments conducted on a developed prototype and various scenarios indicate the obvious advantages of the constructed MAA3C in minimizing the delay cost and refining speed profiles. And the effectiveness, scalability, and stabilization of the MARL solution are ultimately demonstrated. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

Constraining the velocity and direction of vehicles in close proximity is known to reduce the probability of conflicts or even collisions by decreasing the relative velocities of nearby vehicles. This concept is well known from automobile highways, and it forms the basis of concepts like air corridors, air tubes, and, in general, geovectoring. Similar principles apply to the coordination of vehicles flying in a swarm. By constraining and synchronizing velocity and direction the likelihood of a collision is reduced even at higher absolute velocities.Both, geovectoring and swarm coordination, may require a detect-and-avoid solution to become aware of potential conflicts by monitoring the distances and speeds of nearby vehicles. Even in case of a swarm flight using a perfect navigation solution, where in theory no active detect-and-avoid system is necessary, minimal distances have to be known in advance in order to plan the manoeuvres accordingly.We present a method to calculate minimal detection ranges for unmanned aerial applications with constrained velocity vectors. The method is based on parallel simulations considering the individual performance parameters of involved vehicles. Results can be used to formulate requirements for operational concepts, airspace structuring, as well as, technical solutions for detect-and-avoid. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

The FAA and NASA have been working on this, and this chapter describes their approach. The core problem is to safely schedule flights so they never get too close to one another. The theoretical background for posing this problem technically and for solving it analytically is presented. In addition, the computational cost of these methods is discussed, as well as how they scale with the problem size. Of course, there are other practical issues to be considered as well, for example, NASAs traffic management protocol requires the sharing of flight trajectory details between operators when negotiating airspace, thus, it is essential to consider alternatives that allow dense operations while maintaining data privacy. It is also important for the ultimate traffic management system to deal fairly with all users and not be weighted toward participants with large-scale resources. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;N/A

This sizing framework employs a fairly detailed parametric geometry definition of the aircraft and a strip theory and blade element momentum theory based aero-propulsive model, which themselves update during sizing iterations. In lieu of assuming a point mass performance model, the aircraft is trimmed explicitly for both nominal and off-nominal flight conditions for power sizing propulsion system components, and at each point within the mission profile for energy sizing. In lieu of using historical tail volume ratio guidelines for stabilizer sizing, an explicit dynamic stability analysis is incorporated to determine the stabilizer size that achieves specified bare airframe handling qualities targets. A center-of-gravity control logic is incorporated that attempts to achieve a target center-of-gravity location for the sized vehicle. In addition to determining required battery and fuel masses, a volume analysis is performed to determine availability of sufficient energy volume. The effects of varying battery specific energy, battery specific power, wing loading, hover disc loading, mission range, and cruise speed on the sizing of the three propulsion architectures are explored. A comparison of the weight breakdown of the three propulsion variants when sized to the same maximum takeoff mass is presented. Finally, the effects of varying certain point performance requirements for the hybrid-electric architecture, specifically with regard to the power split between fuel-burning and electric power paths, are commented upon. In addition to being insightful, the presented results reinforce the need to incorporate more physics-based analyses, additional stability and control considerations, and configuration optimization studies, which form natural avenues for follow-on work. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Technologies are investigated to improve the overall energy efficiency of flying vehicles, and among these, new powertrain technologies less reliant on fossil fuels are especially promising. Concurrently, the expected growth of new market segments, such as urban air mobility and regional air mobility where vehicles are envisioned to operate over densely populated areas, will lead to increased scrutinity regarding the vehicle emissions and the vehicle safety. In this context, significant research has been carried out in the field of electric and hybrid-electric aircraft propulsion. Driven by significant strides made by the automotive industry regarding electric battery technology, the aspirational goal of useful electric flight is now within reach. Significant challenges nonetheless remain regarding the certification of these new vehicles to ensure an equivalent level of safety. Indeed, the behavior of electric powertrains is more complex than that of traditional powertrains and features additional thermal and ageing constraints that need to be contended with. Moreover, the ability of many of these vehicles to fly both on their wing or on their rotors brings another level of sophistication that will increase the workload of flight crews. Combined, these might adversely impact the safety of flight. This research aims to elucidate some of these challenges by providing insights into the behavior and idiosyncracies of new electrified vehicles and by identifying visual cues that should be provided to flight crews to support safe decision-making in the cockpit. Besides these visual cues, we explore functionalities that a Trajectory Energy Management system could feature to improve flight safety by providing insights into the management of stored usable energy and by monitoring critical parameters of electrified powertrains. This paper includes two use-cases in which the functionality of the Trajectory Energy Management system is explored for pre-flight planning and in-flight diversion decision-making applications. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3486;2022;B.+E.+Sells W.+A.+Crossley;Exploring Vehicle And Fleet Design Spaces For Profitable Urban Air Mobility Operations;Future concepts and fleet allocations for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) depend on system design and analysis to generate expected solutions. Because the market is saturated with vehicle concepts, it is expected that a few will be profitable. Outside of industry efforts, the academic literature has made progress in predicting future concepts for future transportation systems. However, additional research is necessary to predict future UAM concepts using profitability rather than cost. Traditional design and allocation studies leverage cost models to define direct operating costs as a means to estimate the likelihood of successful programs. The traditional approach is useful for established operations (e.g., commercial, business, and general aviation), however, because UAM (or reimagined on-demand mobility via eVTOL) operations are not established, there is an opportunity to expand approaches to look at profitability to ensure the expected solutions address market needs. Because the UAM landscape is constantly changing and the service is rumored to be cost-prohibited, assessing profitability as a means for aircraft design is necessary. This paper provides a system design and analysis approach that focuses on fleet allocation and design tasks under profitability objectives. The paper demonstrates progress with a use-case for the San Francisco Bay Area. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2022-3542;2022;A.+G.+Taye J.+R.+Bertram C.+Fan P.+Wei;Reachability Based Online Safety Verification For High-Density Urban Air Mobility Trajectory Planning;This paper presents a safe and scalable real-time trajectory planning framework for high-density Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The framework extends our previously developed highly efficient Markov Decision Process (MDP) based trajectory planner by adopting a correct-by-construction approach to verify the safety of planning actions. The trajectory planner works in a decentralized manner that allows each aircraft to generate its safe trajectory by accounting for the reachable sets of nearby aircraft. The proposed safety verification module employs a highly scalable data-driven reachability analysis tool to ensure collision-free trajectory planning. Furthermore, the utilized tool over-approximates the reachable set of each aircraft using a discrepancy function, which it learns online from simulation traces. We finally demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed trajectory planner with simulation experiments of up to 120 aircraft in a UAM setting. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3404;2022;H.+K.+Ng J.+Li Y.+Zheng;Noise Impact Analysis For Urban Air Mobility In Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex;This study supports re-design of airspace and procedures for management of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) fleet operations in a given metropolitan area. A goal of UAM is to maintain geographic separation of UAM flight tracks from densely populated areas in order to reduce the potential negative community impact of UAM and manage flight trajectory in anticipation of allowable noise levels and current land use. A UAM route inventory and a demographic-data-optimized topographic map are developed for the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to identify routes or baseline route segments for reduction of noise impact. Noise contours are computed for baseline route and alternative route design given the desired UAM demand level. The impact of UAM fleet noise is predicted based on predicted number of people and noise-sensitive facilities located inside the noise contours. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3417;2022;J.+Murray O.+Molloy G.+Wild S.+Richardson;Safety Review Of Small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems Operations;The utility of small uncrewed aircraft systems (sUAS) has been well established. For example, sUAS operations captured in this research include surveying and photography, policing, firefighting, agricultural spraying, search and rescue, and many others. These operations represent many legacy areas in general aviation. In fact, many of the future applications of autonomous or remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) will encompass even more, such as aeromedical, heavy lift, and even low-capacity transport with urban air mobility (UAM). To that end, it is essential that safety in the industry be regularly and continuously reviewed. In this research we present a review of the current data set of RPAS safety occurrences (accidents and incidents) in the Australian Transport Safety Board dataset, from May 2008 to July 2021, consisting of 429 cases. These are analyzed in terms of their key categorical properties, specifically, occurrence type, occurrence category, type of operation, and phase of flight. Findings show that accidents account for over 75% of occurrences, likely indicating the under reporting of incidents. Collisions with terrain accounted for almost 90% of occurrences, and similarly 90% of occurrences occurred during maneuvering and not during critical phases of flight like crewed occurrences. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

With the advancements in technologies across the various disciplines, legacy conceptual design tools developed for traditional tube-and-wing concepts do not adequately address the design of aircraft for the Urban Air Mobility domain. Effectively modeling the highly coupled disciplinary analyses without incurring the significant computational cost associated with higher fidelity modeling is important for the development of electric and hybrid-electric aircraft concepts. The IDEA tool is a multi-fidelity, multi-disciplinary design architecture for aircraft and controller design. Multiple fidelities of aerodynamics are incorporated into the tool to help capture the necessary physics of propulsion-airframe interactions. A multi-fidelity surrogate generation technique enables efficient combination of different fidelities of information to improve the overall model fidelity with reduced computational cost. A high-fidelity structural analysis capability is developed to determine the structural performance and improve the aircraft weight estimation. Including controller synthesis in a conceptual design framework is an important component and is necessary to account for handling qualities and ride comfort in the design stages. This paper describes our ongoing efforts in setting up this framework-including setting up the disciplinary analyses and performing trade studies for an electric Lift+Cruise concept. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3545;2022;L.+Preis M.+Husemann M.+Shamiyeh E.+Stumpf;Time And Energy Saving Potential Of Efficient Urban Air Mobility Airspace Structures;Novel electric propulsion technology has given rise to thinking about Urban Air Mobility in a new way with its expected high degree of operational flexibility. The designs of eVTOL configurations are determined by their mission profile, which we found to be over-simplified at many points in the current scientific literature. There is a gap of understanding which impact the mission profile has on travel time and energy demand. In this paper we review various mission designs, formulate a 5-segment flight profile (including vertical descent, climb, cruise, descent and vertical approach) and apply it on a fleet level of up to 200,000 UAM trips. The demand data originates from the upper Bavaria region study OBUAM. In a sensitivity study we vary cruise altitude, height of the vertical flight segments and the climb & descent angles for two vehicle configurations: a fixed-wing tilt-rotor concept and a multicopter concept. The main findings for the fixed-wing concept are that the height of the vertical flight segments and the cruise altitude should be as low as possible and small climb angles (below 7 degrees) should be avoided. The multicopter concept, however, is penalized by fast forward flight while being comparatively insensitive to both cruise altitude and height of the vertical segments. Further, we found a trade-off between time-and energy-optimal flight with the a energy-optimized climb/descent angle around 10 degree. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3317;2022;S.+Chen P.+Wei A.+D.+Evans M.+E.+Nova;Estimating Airspace Resource Capacity For Advanced Air Mobility Operations;Demand capacity balancing (DCB) has been proposed as a strategic mechanism to balance efficiency and predictability for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations when operational uncertainties are high. In this paper we seek to determine how DCB can be implemented to ensure safe and efficient UAM operations in coordination with a tactical deconfliction system. We use simulations to explore the safety of representative UAM operations applying tactical deconfliction methods, and estimate airspace resource capacities that could be applied, using DCB, to ensure safe and efficient UAM operations. We apply this approach to determine airspace capacity in two baseline route structures-simulating merging flows and crossing flows respectively-which are then applied to a hypothetical UAM network in New York City. The benefits of DCB to support tactical deconfliction for safety assurance across a range of demand values is demonstrated and compared to safety metrics applying tactical deconfliction only, and to a baseline without DCB or tactical deconfliction. In addition, we also show the trade-off between ground delay and safety metrics while implementing various levels of DCB. The results suggest that DCB may be a feasible mechanism to ensure safe and efficient UAM operations. The results also reveal some early insights into interactions between the strategic DCB and the tactical deconfliction. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3971;2022;T.+Kilbourne F.+Wieland C.+Snipes;Implementing A Cloud-Based Flight Management System;Achieving Trajectory Based Operations (TBO) beyond the FAAs current NextGen plans will require the introduction of new technologies, systems, and procedures. Similarly, new Air Traffic Management (ATM) capabilities will be required to permit routine Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations, and UAS Traffic Management (UTM). To enable these new aviation operations in a safe, scalable, and efficient manner within the National Airspace System (NAS), some of these advancements will require new automation capabilities on the air vehicles. However, aircraft avionics evolve very slowly. Flight Management System (FMS) manufacturers develop new models infrequently, usually with only incremental changes. To help ameliorate the problems outlined above, we are building a prototype Cloud-Based Flight Management System (CFMS), whereby safety-critical functions residing on the flight deck are separated from non-safety-critical functions that reside in a cloud-based environment on the ground. This paper discusses the CFMS concept and its initial implementation. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A

Farassat F1A Formulation;This study focuses on the integration of established acoustic prediction techniques directly into a surface-vorticity solver. The main objective is to enhance an aircraft designers ability to characterize the acoustic signatures generated by urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles in general, and Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) concepts in particular. The solver that we employ, FlightStream, consists of a reliable, surface-vorticity panel code that incorporates viscous boundary-layer corrections. It thus constitutes a computationally efficient commercial tool developed specifically for conceptual design and preliminary aerodynamic analysis. By implementing the Farassat F1A acoustics formulation directly into the solver, a new intuitive capability is achieved, which is both conversive with modern engineering tools and efficient in terms of setup and speed of execution. In this work, this capability is demonstrated using three particular case studies consisting of both single-and six-propeller Joby S4 UAM electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) as well as a Kittyhawk KH-H1 DEP vehicle. The details of this tool along with its physical characteristics and underlying equations are showcased herein whereas its acoustic metrics, which can be effectively used to characterize the noisiness of the sound generated by a UAM in flight, are described in a companion article. By embedding this assortment of insightful metrics into a simple and user-friendly flow solver, a much improved flow-acoustic analysis capability is thereby provided to support the design of future aircraft. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3512;2022;V.+Savane T.+Moecker M.+Dreau;Parametric Composite Defect Template For Urban Air Mobility;In order to ensure structural integrity, Urban/Advanced Air Mobility (UAM/AAM) vehicle manufacturers are required to perform fatigue and damage tolerance (F&DT) studies across design, manufacturing, and in-service stages. There is high chance that these vehicles will be made of composites, wherein different defects can occur during manufacturing and while the vehicle is in service. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) can be used to understand the effect of defects on structural performance and build better confidence for certification. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to model pre-existing defects in an existing structural analysis with the use of templates. Such templates provide an accessible packaging of the modeling and simulation methods to various analysts. Damage tolerance analysis done in this way helps in quickly evaluating acceptable composite defect type and size and easily shares modelling expertise among all users. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3319;2022;Y.+Wu S.+Deniz Y.+Shi Z.+Wang;A Convex Optimization Approach To Real-Time Merging Control Of Evtol Vehicles For Future Urban Air Mobility;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper focused on real-time, model-based optimization for merging control of air vehicles under the urban air mobility (UAM) concept of operations. The merging control of UAM vehicles flying along different airways or air corridors would become a bottleneck in the development and implementation of future UAM systems. In this preliminary work, we consider the merging control of two electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles and formulate an optimal control problem that incorporates the flight dynamics of the vehicle and collision avoidance constraint. Two objective functions, i.e., minimum flight time and minimum control cost, are considered in the problem formulation. The problems are first solved using a general-purpose optimal control solver (GPOPS). Then, we introduce several new control variables to reduce the nonlinearity of the dynamic system, apply a lossless convexification technique to relax the resulting nonconvex control constraint, linearize the nonlinear terms in the dynamics, and develop a sequential convex programming method as an alternative approach to the UAM merging control problem considered in this paper. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the developed methods. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A

Panel method, borrowed from fluid dynamics domain, is a numeric tool for calculating the potential field around arbitrarily shaped objects. Resultant potential field can be used for generating collision free trajectories for uncrewed aerial vehicles with convergence guarantee. Robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated during indoor experiments with a wind generator creating wind speed up to 7 m/s and also during outdoor experiments with wind speeds ranging between 3-5 m/s. Experiment results suggest that panel method based path planning scheme maintains its obstacle avoidance property under wind disturbances. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3415;2022;S.+Kim C.+Harris C.+Y.+Justin D.+Mavris;Optimal Trajectory And En-Route Contingency Planning For Urban Air Mobility Considering Battery Energy Levels;Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an electric propelled, vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft envisioned for transporting passengers and goods within metropolitan areas. Planning UAM flights will not be easy as unexpected wind turbulence from high-altitude structures may impact the vehicles operating at a low altitude. Furthermore, considering the short travel time of the UAM, smart and safe decision-making will be challenging, particularly in off-nominal situations that force the aircraft to divert to an alternate destination instead of landing at the initially planned destination. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes automated pre-flight and in-flight contingency planning systems to assist in both normal and irregular UAM operations. A planner in the pre-flight planning system optimizes an aerial trajectory between the scheduled origin and destination, avoiding restricted high-level structures and estimating energy levels. In the contingency planning system, an in-flight replanner produces several optimal trajectories from where the diversion is declared to each alternate destination candidate. A diversion decision-making tool then scores a list of candidates and selects the best site for diversion. Real-world operational scenarios in the city of Miami are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3461;2022;J.+Gutierrez N.+Neogi D.+Kaeli E.+Dill;A High-Performance Computing Gnss-Aware Path Planning Algorithm For Safe Urban Flight Operations;The emergence and development of advanced technologies and vehicle types have created a growing demand for new forms of flight operations. These new and increasingly complex operational paradigms, such as Advanced and Urban Air Mobility (AAM/UAM), present regulatory authorities and the aviation community with several design-and-implementation challenges  particularly for highly autonomous vehicles. An overarching and daunting task is to develop protocols that can integrate these operations without compromising safety or disrupting traditional airspace operations. A shift toward a more predictive, autonomous, risk mitigation capability becomes critical to meet this challenge. This paper proposes and evaluates a computationally-efficient path planning approach to perform pre-flight planning and autonomous in-flight re-routing to minimize exposures to selected hazards. In our evaluation, hazards associated with degraded and missing critical GPS navigation data are considered. In this paper, we first present a high-performance computing path planning approach based on an adapted Bellman-Ford algorithm, developed in the CUDA programming language. Using the adapted path planning algorithm, we test this algorithm when encountering issues with GPS quality, and deliver an implementation that can produce flight paths that minimize exposure to risks, while maintaining a low computational burden. In our evaluation, the computation of periodic and aperiodic path updates are evaluated, prioritizing specific events as triggers for updates, based on changes to satellite availability. These critical events can lead to significant exposure to navigational hazards if not dealt with correctly. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this paper, we consider drone-taxi services which is one of major applications of UAM networks. The proposed algorithm designs joint truthful and distributed aerial drone-taxi scheduling which is based on second price auction (SPA). Furthermore, the SPA procedure is improved via deep learning framework for revenue-optimality. After the truthful and distributed scheduling, the passengers in the drone-taxi can utilize video streaming services where the services are under delay constraints. Therefore, in order to maximize video streaming quality under the delay constraints, the proposed algorithm is designed based on Lyapunov optimization framework. Simulation results verifies that the proposed algorithm achieves desired performance improvements. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

Noise Characterization Metrics;This work identifies seven aeroacoustic post-processing metrics that facilitate urban air mobility (UAM) vehicle noise prediction. An increase in production and use of UAM and distributed electric propulsion (DEP) vehicles within populated civilian areas stands behind the need to minimize the noise produced by these vehicles. The FAAs strict noise regulations on UAM aircraft compels designers to place a significant emphasis, early in the design phase, on the characterization and analysis of the external noise produced by these vehicles, namely, to ensure their design viability. Whereas a number of codes such as ANOPP, WOPWOP, ASSPIN, CHARM, and so on, have been developed specifically for this purpose, they generally lack a friendly graphical user interface or an acoustics post-processing toolbox that can provide all of the metrics needed to secure the requisite aircraft certifications or required modifications. To overcome this deficiency, this work focuses on the analysis and interpretation of predicted noise signals using a set of characteristic metrics that can be instrumental in guiding the design process. Following a thorough review of metrics standardized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as well as the Federal Aviation Association (FAA), seven metrics are identified, evaluated, and discussed in the context of UAM noise prediction. When used in conjunction with FlightStream, a modern surface-vorticity panel code, these metrics are shown to provide a complementary assortment of tools to concisely describe UAM-based acoustic signal properties. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, two significant questions remain unexplored: (1) What is the value of UAM in a regions transportation network? and (2) How can UAM be effectively deployed to realize and maximize this value to all stakeholders, including riders and local economies? To adequately understand the value proposition of UAM for metropolitan areas, the authors develop a holistic multi-modal toolchain, SimUAM, to model and simulate UAM and its impacts on travel behavior. This toolchain has several components: (1) Microsimulation Analysis for Network Traffic Assignment (MANTA): A fast, high-fidelity regional-scale traffic microsimulator, (2) VertiSim: A granular, discrete-event vertiport and pedestrian simulator, (3) Flexible Engine for Fast-time Evaluation of Flight Environments (Fe3 ): A high-fidelity, trajectory-based aerial microsimulation. SimUAM, rooted in granular, GPU-based microsimulation, models millions of trips and their movements in the street network and in the air, producing interpretable and actionable performance metrics for UAM designs and deployments. Once the ground-air interface is modeled, the authors find that the market for UAM decreases across all network designs relative to models with static assumptions about transfer times. However, significant improvements can be made to balance the demand and optimize the networks for transfer time, likely increasing the number of benefited trips. The modularity, extensibility, and speed of the platform will allow for rapid scenario planning and sensitivity analysis, effectively acting as a detailed performance assessment tool. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Changes in the local climate conditions can significantly affect future urban air mobility viability, possibly restricting operations even further. This study aims to assess the impacts of changing climate conditions on a hypothetical urban air mobility network in Chicago to determine the networks sensitivity to changes in climate. The proposed data-driven approach identifies the extreme weather days for Urban Air Mobility operations from the 2006 to 2020 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Integrated Surface Database. We further assess the sensitivity by increasing the rate of extreme weather events and calculating the impact of these changes on the Chicago metropolitan area. Via this analysis, we found that an increase in extreme weather days from 5% to 10% frequency reduced the percentage of viable UAM trips from 62% to 48% in winter. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

We analyze progress in the Synod consensus protocolwhich does not assume a unique leaderunder the assumptions of asynchronous communication and potential agent failures. We identify a set of sufficient conditions under which it is possible to guarantee that a set of agents will eventually attain consensus using Synod. First, a subset of the agents must not permanently fail or exhibit Byzantine failure until consensus is reached, and second, at least one proposal must be eventually uninterrupted by higher-numbered proposals. To formally reason about agent failures, we introduce a failure-aware actor model (FAM). Using FAM, we model the identified conditions and provide a formal proof of eventual progress in Synod. Our proof has been mechanically verified using the Athena proof assistant and, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first machine-checked proof of eventual progress in Synod. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.;N/A

First, the aircraft kinetic models for both fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft are investigated, along with the corresponding ballistic and glide descent mode and the associated wind influence. The probabilistic impact to road traffic and pedestrians on the ground as a result of potential crash are then derived. With an assumed crash probability of the aircraft, the initial risk value and distribution are computed, which are used to produce a risk cost map across the mission area. Next, the flight request is processed based on such risk map using a common path planning algorithm, minimizing the overall risk for the flight plan to be generated. Finally, a preliminary case study involving a rotorcraft conducting urban cargo transportation service is performed to evaluate the proposed risk assessment method in a real-world urban environment. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These rotating systems are axial, low solidity rotor-stator assemblies operating in the low subsonic and transitional regime at approach. Directivity measurements of the far-field acoustic pressure have first been achieved in the anechoic wind tunnel at Universit de Sherbrooke. Noise signatures with both strong tonal, quasi-tonal (subharmonic humps) and broadband components are found. Lattice-Boltzmann simulations are then performed on the same ducted fan in the anechoic wind tunnel in order to understand the noise mechanisms. Grid convergence of the acoustic spectra is already achieved. The direct farfield noise computations show a good overall match with experimental data. The origin of the subharmonic humps is already traced to the tip vortices staying in the rotational plane and interacting with the subsequent blades. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA., All rights reserved.;N/A

Expected high density of UAM operation requires advanced management strategy of airspace resources. In this paper, we present an Airspace-Resources-Centric (ARC) approach for UAM flight planning. In the first place, an ARC concept for urban airspace management is developed. Then a method for 4D trajectory planning with optimal airspace utilization was designed under the concept. The method consists three steps. Firstly, a flight level is assigned to each flight plan. Secondly, an optimal 3D path is generated by A* algorithm and is smoothed. Lastly, 4D trajectory generation is modeled as a mathematical optimization problem, and is solved by a commercial solver. Numerical simulation results show that the method plans trajectory for UAM with less than 1 second computational time per flight. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA., All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2022-2916;2022;S.+K.+Li S.+Lee;Extensions And Applications Of Lyu And AytonS Serrated Trailing-Edge Noise Model To Rotorcraft;This paper presents the theoretical predictions of broadband noise on rotors with serrated trailing edges. Lyu and Aytons airfoil serrated trailing-edge noise model is extended for the finite span length, the correct acoustic attenuation rate of trailing-edge noise, the modified spanwise wavenumber, and the scattering factor in Roger and Moreaus trailing-edge noise model. This new theoretical model is implemented in the rotorcraft broadband noise tool, UCD-QuietFly. The validations show good agreements with experimental data for serrated trailing-edge noise of a wing section, a hovering rotor, and a forward-flight rotor. Next, the effects of serration parameters on rotor broadband noise are studied. For optimal and realistic rotor broadband noise reduction, the desirable design of a serrated-blade rotor has the serration height to wavelength ratio of 2 and the radial range of serrations from 50% blade span to the tip. It is also found that the sine-wave, chopped peak, or saw-tooth serration shapes reduce noise most among various shapes that are considered. Finally, noise reduction with serrations is applied to two urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft. A 6-passenger eVTOL quadrotor is found to have more than 9 dB noise reduction potential with serrated trailing edges, where higher noise reductions are observed with higher tip speeds and fewer blades. Serrated-blade quadrotors in hover are found to have the dipole broadband noise directivity, and noise reductions are observed at all observer angles. A quiet helicopter with serrated blades in forward flight is found to have the maximum noise reduction in the forward direction. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The following survey provides an overview of assumptions and expectations regarding the future development of the UAM-market in terms of passenger transportation with focus on the European market. In contrast to many other surveys, not the expectations of possible users were of special interest, but the assessment of industry, research facilities and associations. In particular the survey provides an insight into the assessment of technological developments in the areas of vehicle requirements, airspace integration and the level of autonomy. In addition, the survey outlines the assumed market potential of different use cases in various world regions and also contains an assessment of a time horizon for the realization of air taxi transports. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Rotor speed and variable pitch-controlled variants of a six-passenger conceptual design vehicle were assessed with different levels of degradation to control response and disturbance rejection bandwidth (DRB) in the heave axis. In previous work, preliminary trends across several handling quality rating categories reflected the effects of these degradations. Additionally, the impact of using different test standards and turbulence on the ratings were discussed. This paper elaborates on those results, but also provides insight into unexpected trends observed during the study including: a disharmony in attitude response, subpar ratings for the baseline Level 1 performance vehicle, and excessive drift and yaw couplings observed in a lateral reposition maneuver. Moreover, shortcomings of the handling quality scales and comparisons of power consumption among the vehicles in the various test conditions are presented.

The goal of this research is to help the xTM community to scale and adapt to meet the operational needs of new entrant vehicles and operations by adopting a federated and automated service-based air traffic management structure. While this xTM system will mostly address the needs of new entrants, it is likely to also need some interaction with the existing traffic management environment. To help inform NASAs research, we elicited knowledge from industry participants. Specifically, we engaged more than 25 leading companies who are developing and/or planning to operate xTM vehicles or systems to discuss current and anticipated interactions with traditional air traffic services in several new entrant categories including high-altitude platform systems/stations (HAPS), small and large uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), urban air mobility (UAM), supersonics, as well as supporting technology providers. The feedback we received from industry includes their perspectives on significant challenges, requirements, and priorities, this feedback helps NASA to identify areas where further research is needed. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA., All rights reserved.;N/A

High-order accurate schemes, dual-time stepping, and the delayed detached-eddy simulation model have been employed. A loose-coupling approach between the flow solver and the rotorcraft comprehensive code is implemented to include vehicle trim and blade motions. Acoustic simulations based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equations have been performed to compute the rotor noise. Different blade geometries and tip speeds are analyzed, and performance and acoustics results are compared. The vehicle has been simulated in hover and cruise, with flight conditions representative of an air taxi mission.

This will be accomplished with distributed electric powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. The low specific energy of the current generation lithium-ion battery packs limit the operational range of the electric aircraft. Limited range impacts safety by reducing the amount of time available for analyzing the potential impact of errors and failures and responding to them, and for flying to an alternative landing area or returning to the base. It is therefore critical to understand the impact of flight and environmental conditions on the onboard lithium-ion battery packs health. With this as the motivation, the procedure for evaluating the performance of battery packs in a laboratory setting is evaluated. The results obtained using this procedure on battery packs subject to power draw characteristics of a simulated flight of a NASA conceptual multirotor aircraft model are described. The fully charged battery is allowed to discharge at specific C-rates based on the power draw profile during the experiment, and the current and voltages are recorded as a function of time. Observed results under different operating conditions and mission profiles are discussed. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2022-3653;2022;K.+Wendt A.+Knig F.+Naser;Development Of A Modular Model City For Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle Experiments  A Visionary Concept;Several Urban Air Mobility (UAM) companies are currently in the ground and flight testing phase of their product development, aiming to enter into daily business in the current decade. Moreover, the number and variety of unmanned aircraft systems applications constantly grows, reaching from agriculture to medical services. However, the majority of flight tests in Europe is not being conducted in a public manner due to regulatory barriers, and a missing representative urban environment. To overcome this challenge, the German Aerospace Center plans to set-up a model city for investigations on UAM operations in an urban model environment. UAM includes the holistic consideration of airspace users in the urban environment, i.e. in particular drones and future air cabs. The envisioned infrastructure shall be used for testing in all facets of the urban air mobility context, such as vehicle concepts, flight planning and sensor technologies as well as acceptance studies, in a protected environment. The planned model city will not represent a specific metropole in a small scale but aims to represent typical areas of a larger central European city in all its diversity. Based on literature research, typical density of buildings, arrays of buildings and their height were identified as key figures. Moreover, the interdisciplinary approach, i.e. considering flight guidance, communication and navigation, and flight system requirements as well as environmental and civil restrictions, is outlined in this paper. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Both private industry and military groups have turned toward heavier, more capable unmanned aerial systems (UAS), such as those classified as group-3, as a tool for moving heavier payloads with the aim of reducing human workload in urban air mobility and package delivery. The development of these large UAS has presented a number of problems requiring research, such as assured autonomy issues, reliability and safety concerns, and power supply issues. However, due to the size, added complexity, and cost of group-3 UAS, many universities and federally funded research facilities are not able to investigate these problems and test their solutions on an actual group-3 UAS, instead using smaller, commercial off the shelf units. Using these smaller UAS however does not sufficiently simulate the true nature of a group-3 UAS, in terms of capability, flight operations, dynamics, storage, transportation, and maintenance requirements. This paper discusses the design, flight tests, and use cases of an economical group-3 UAS specifically designed for the research and development sector. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2022;M.+Richards;Advanced Seat Belt System For Occupant Restraint;Current passive occupant restraints do not adequately restrict upper torso/head motion during a crash, especially with a combined forward and vertical acceleration component. The belt geometry of conventional webbing restraints allows the upper torso to rotate forward, increasing the probability of secondary impacts. In addition to the suboptimal belt geometry issues, some occupants are not familiar with the current 4-point and 5-point restraints. Safe, Inc. has developed a passive restraint system with improved belt routing geometry to reduce the occupant's motion and resulting injury risk. The restraint supplements the familiar automotive 3-point restraint system with a second, mirror image diagonal shoulder belt to provide upper torso restraint in all directions. It is intuitive to don with minimal installation instruction to encourage more frequent and proper use. The restraint would be beneficial to all vehicle types and is well suited for the emerging Urban Air Mobility (UAM) platforms. Copyright 2022 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved;N/A

The approved model for assessing environmental impact of air traffic actions in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT), does not directly support analysis of such operations due to a combined lack of UAM aircraft flight performance model data and aircraft noise data. This paper addresses the latter by offering two prediction-based approaches for generation of noise-power-distance (NPD) data for use within AEDT. One utilizes AEDTs fixed-wing aircraft modeling approach and the other utilizes the rotary-wing aircraft modeling approach. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-3076;2022;A.+Kvurt O.+Stalnov;From The Blade Geometry To Prediction Of Tonal Noise Component In Hover;Global interest in urban air mobility and small multi-rotor unmanned aerial systems is rapidly growing. Multi-rotors can fly in every direction, horizontally and vertically, and hover. However, the acoustic signature of these vehicles is of great concern. In the present study, the modelling of tonal noise components is implemented in a three-step approach. In the first and the second steps, the method requires modelling the steady and the unsteady components of aerodynamic loads, respectively. Steady aerodynamic loads are estimated with Blade Element Momentum Theory and XFOIL panel code, whereas the unsteady deterministic components are modelled with either Sears or Loewy functions. In the third step, the harmonic noise components are predicted. Aerodynamic loads and tonal noise components are modelled and compared with experiments conducted in the newly established anechoic chamber at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The second and the third sound harmonics are predicted with high accuracy. The satisfactory agreement of thrust, torque and tonal noise results concerning the experimental measurements validated the proposed approach for predicting performances and noise radiation associated with low-Reynolds number propellers at the engineering level. The work can be seen as the infrastructure for rotor design. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2022-3613;2022;P.+Wu J.+Chen;Online Evaluation For Chance-Constrained Geofences Under Data-Driven Uncertainties;Urban air mobility (UAM) using electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is an emerging way of air transportation within metropolitan areas. A key challenge for the success of UAM is how to manage large-scale flight operations with safety guarantee in high-density, dynamic and uncertain airspace environments in real time. To deal with these challenges, in this paper we combine the concept of geofence and chance constraints to obtain chance-constrained geofences under data-driven uncertainties, which can guarantee that the probability of potential conflicts between eVTOL aircraft is bounded given a general empirical distribution. To evaluate the chance-constrained geofences in an online fashion, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is adopted and customized to model data-driven uncertainties. Comprehensive numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the online evaluation of chance-constrained geofence through the algorithm of FFT-based KDE. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-2946;2022;O.+L.+Pinto G.+Bossotto F.+Afonso F.+P.+Lau;On Rotor Aeroacoustic Optimization For Urban Air Mobility;This article presents an optimization study of the noise produced by rotors in the context of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The importance of this study is based on the expected growth of UAM in larger cities across the globe and on the consequent effort to decrease the noise emitted by this type of aircraft. Provided that rotors constitute a major part of the noise produced by this aviation segment, given the fact that the aircraft are intended to be fully electric, the design of these components is of paramount importance for noise minimization. Herein, the focus is on small rotors given the availability of experimental data to compare the numerical results. For the simulation accomplished within the optimization process, an open-source aerodynamic and aeroacoustic code (FLOWUnsteady, or FLight, Optimization, and Wind Unsteady) was integrated within an optimization module created specifically for the current work. These tools are based on the Formulation 1A of Farassat (PSU-WOPWOP) and the Brooks-Pope-Marcolini airfoil noise model (FLOWNoise), being utilized for the prediction of the tonal and atonal noise, respectively. The simulation code is applied to predict rotor noise which is posteriorly reduced by the means of a gradient-free optimization algorithm, leading to the proposed optimal rotor design, with a reduction of 16,21% of the Energy Averaged Overall Sound Pressure Level (EAOSPL) having been achieved. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

To describe the evolution of UAM state of operations, NASA has outlined 6 UAM Maturity Levels (UML1-UML6). The FAA and NASA have each released Concept of Operations for UML-1 and UML-4, respectively. They outline the UAM operational framework, the role of stakeholders, infrastructures, and the level of automation. A more mature states of operations begin at UML-5, where autonomous networks are highly integrated into ground-based remote piloting operations. Safe and Secured Assured Autonomy (S2A2) is a NASA University Leadership Initiative (ULI) project aimed at developing autonomy-enabled algorithms for perception, sensing, coordination, planning, navigation, detecting and responding to malicious attacks on the cyber-physical systems. Verification and validation processes are being developed to certify the algorithms. The challenge remains to architect a systems integration pipeline to fit all the different aspects above into a UAM system-of-systems context. This paper uses Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach for a UML-5 operational environment where S2A2 algorithms will cohesively work together while performing their independent functions. We use SysML to define the UAM operating context, its stakeholders, their state transitions, and functions for a nominal UAM operations scenario.

The majority of these concepts sport Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities taking advantage of progress made in the electric power delivery and storage systems. Acoustically the vertical takeoff and landing operations vary significantly to conventional fixed wing aircraft as drastic changes in the dominating noise sources, the air vehicle speed, trajectory, power settings and observer distances occur. This paper initiates the study of generating noise exposure contour maps for eVTOL aircraft, their unique operations and importantly the transition between vertical and horizontal flight. The method involves the generation of three-dimensional noise exposure surfaces surrounding the flightpath. The flightpath itself is deconstructed into fundamental operations such as hover, vertical climb/decent and flyover, allowing data in the format of Noise-Power-Distance curves to provide inputs for the various power settings. The aircraft is modeled as a lumped noise source whose directivity may rotate independently of the motion of the aircraft. Results using simple acoustic sources (monopoles and dipoles) along with more complex directivity patterns (using a spherical harmonic expansion) are generated and discussed. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-2821;2022;M.+B.+Galles M.+G.+Jones D.+M.+Nark;An Initial Assessment Of Variable Depth Liner Optimization For Ducted Proprotor Applications;The potential rise of the Urban Air Mobility market has spurred the design of a new generation of novel aircraft. To aid industry and researchers interested in these types of aircraft, the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology project at NASA has developed a fleet of reference vehicles for system studies. A new six-passenger reference vehicle has recently been added to the research portfolio that has ducted proprotors for propulsors. The ducts present an opportunity to apply acoustic treatment to the interior of the duct that could target both tonal and broadband noise, representative of the sound produced by this type of propulsor. In this paper, methodologies are presented to design a variable depth liner for this application. An optimizer is used to design multiple liners with variable chamber depths. Experimental results from normal impedance testing are compared to numerical predictions using the optimizer model and a finite element model. Results show that an optimizer can be used to design an acoustic liner with favorable performance for a broad range of frequencies, which could be appropriate for a ducted proprotor application. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2022;A.+Chopra R.+Healy F.+Gandhi O.+Sahni;A Comparison Of High-Fidelity Simulation Approaches For Interactional Aerodynamics Of Multirotor Systems In Forward Flight;Recent advancements in distributed electric propulsion for urban air mobility applications have made interactional aerodynamics more common on modern rotorcraft designs. Rotor-to-rotor interactions are associated with complex flow features, and require high-fidelity numerical tools for adequate analysis and prediction. The computational cost associated with resolving these aerodynamic interactions can become prohibitively expensive, particularly when simulations over a multitude of operating conditions/configurations are desired. As an alternative to the typical blade-resolved DDES (BR-DDES) approach, an actuator line model with LES (ALM-LES) is considered for its high fidelity aerodynamic prediction capabilities at a reduced computational cost. In this study, flow field and rotor performance predictions using ALM-LES are compared to BR-DDES in order to evaluate the merits of ALM-LES for interactional aerodynamic analysis. Overall, the wake structure of the two-rotor system shows good agreement between the two methods. Integrated thrust is also predicted similarly, with a difference of 2.4% for the front rotor and 4.3% for the aft rotor. While integrated thrust is predicted well by ALM-LES, some discrepancies in sectional thrust are observed in areas with blade-vortex interaction (BVI). The vortex position compares well between the two methods, so the sectional thrust difference is tied to differences in vortex strength and how well ALM is able to represent a BVI. Sectional thrust differences are also observed on the aft rotor and are associated with secondary vortices convecting into the rotor plane. Despite differences in parts of the rotor disk with BVI, ALM-LES is shown to be capable of predicting the interactional aerodynamics of a two-rotor system in forward flight at about 1% the computational cost of BR-DDES.

To approach these challenges, we propose a consolidated concept design of battery-fuel cell hybrid tiltrotor aircraft with a liquid hydrogen (LH2) fuel tank. The efficiency of a battery-fuel cell hybrid powertrain system on the designed eVTOL aircraft is compared to that of a battery-only powertrain system.

Increasing the overall voltage of the power conversion system and switching frequency is the most effective way of boosting efficiency while reducing system mass by quadratically reducing the system joule losses and the size of passive components. However, the high voltage and high-frequency system impose serious risks of partial discharge (PD) and electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise through degraded insulations and capacitive leakage current paths. Under repetitive voltage pulses with a high slew rate (i.e., wide bandgap-based drives with high switching speed), these high-frequency electromagnetic phenomena coincide during the switching transition, making it difficult to measure, analyze, and detect. This paper provides a comprehensive study of PD and EMI in high-frequency and high-speed WBG-based electric propulsion systems under repetitive voltage pulse with a high slew rate. This paper also investigates the common-mode EMI noise spectrum considering a high-frequency electric machine as well as PD models to identify the correlation between EMI and PD phenomena in AC machine drives. The correlation between EMI and PD was validated via experiment. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

A neutral-point-clamped, cascade H-Bridge and flying capacitors are the potential candidates for these applications, but these conventional MLIs have either stacked or floating capacitors causing voltage unbalancing and drifting issues in variable-speed operation. In this paper, a new neutral-point-less (NPL) MLI topology is proposed, which requires neither stacked nor floating capacitors, topologically addressing the voltage balancing and drifting issues. The new NPL MLI topology, namely X-type inverter, reduces the required capacitance and volume of the dc-link capacitor by over 75% compared to that of the conventional MLI topologies. In addition, the X-type inverter produces two equal and opposite common-mode (CM) voltage waveforms, which cancel out the capacitive leakage current for the minimum CM electromagnetic interference (CM EMI) noise. This paper introduces the new NPL MLI topology and the underlying principle of multilevel operation without stacked or floating capacitors. The simulation results verify the NPL multilevel operation with a single dc-link capacitor and over 50 dBuV CM EMI noise reduction compared to that of the conventional two-level inverter. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

10.1109/ITEC53557.2022.9813967;2022;T.+Tallerico A.+D.+Smith;Combined Electromagnetic And Thermal Design Optimization Studies Of In-Slot Cooling For Uam Electric Motors;Urban Air Mobility vehicles will require high specific power and high reliability electric motors. Motor specific power is limited by the temperature limits of stator winding insulation and the motor cooling system's ability to extract heat from the motor windings. The temperature limits of the stator winding are set by both thermal-chemical aging and thermo-mechanical stresses. In-slot cooling is known to be able to both more effectively reduce the max hotspot temperature in a winding and the thermo-mechanical stress in a winding at a given hotspot temperature relative to external cooling jackets. In this paper, a combined electromagnetic, thermal, and mechanical optimization of in-slot cooled motors for UAM applications is completed. Initial thermal and mechanical studies of in-slot cooling topologies with a reference design were used to down select an in-slot cooled topology for optimization. Optimizations were carried out for both the in-slot cooled topology and a traditional externally cooled motor. Results show that the in-slot cooling topology can achieve a smaller mass than a traditional water jacket cooled design, but at the cost of lower efficiency due to larger required stator thicknesses and correspondingly larger stator iron loss. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

Specifically, (1) what are the initial perceptions of PAVs by the public, and (2) what are the differences between early and laggard adopters of PAVs. Background: The emergence of Urban Air Mobility presents an opportunity to increase transportation capacity in densely populated metropolitan areas. However, successful integration is largely dependent on adoption and acceptance from communities. Method: A survey of 407 respondents across the United States provides insights from potential users. The Technology Adoption Life Cycle and Technology Acceptance Model are used to characterize adopter profiles and rates of adoption. Results: Respondents not only expect the same level of safety standards as conventional aircraft (i.e., seatbelts, air quality), but even more feedback (i.e., displays on current and projected flight operations). PAVs are not an immediate replacement for daily trips once available. In-cabin noise is not a crucial deterrent to ridership. Earlier PAV adopters are trusting of the technology, willing to pay more to ride, and exhibit overall riskier behaviors. Later PAV adopters need more feedback in-flight and a pilot on-board. Conclusion: PAV manufacturers, operators, and policymakers can utilize these findings to incorporate crucial design elements needed for PAVs to satisfy user expectations.

Enabling urban air mobility operations in the National Airspace System will require significant coordination across the aviation and transportation communities, including the general aviation community. The urban air mobility operating vision will introduce new and complex interactions to these pilots, driving a need for coordinated operating procedures that align with the needs of each community. This paper summarizes an exploratory human-in-the-loop experiment performed at The MITRE Corporation to explore general aviation pilot perspectives on proximate urban air mobility operations. Pilot participants used a certified flight deck simulator to fly a route in an environment with various urban air mobility traffic configurations. Objective and subjective measures were collected to understand general aviation pilot perspectives. Results indicate pilot preference for a limited number of corridors within a segment of airspace even at higher urban air mobility traffic rates. Acceptability of other urban air mobility operating concepts explored in this research study decreased with an increase in urban air mobility traffic rates. 2022 by The MITRE Corporation.

We hypothesized that trust directly influences the attitude and intention to use UAM, while service quality factors affect its perceived usefulness and ease of use. A survey data of 450 respondents were analysed by using a partial least squares structural equation model. The results show that trust positively influences the intention to use UAM, and safety perception contributes the most to UAMs trustworthiness. In addition, transport service quality factors (i.e., time-saving, availability, flight comfort, and perceived cost) significantly explained the perceived usefulness and/or ease of use. Path coefficients of the structural model indicate that trust has a greater impact on the user's attitude toward UAM than perceived usefulness. The results of this study contribute to increasing the early user adoption of UAM. 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;N/A
10.1109/TTE.2022.3183933;2022;J.+A.+Swanke T.+M.+Jahns;Reliability Analysis Of A Fault-Tolerant Integrated Modular Motor Drive For An Urban Air Mobility Aircraft Using Markov Chains;Electrified urban air mobility (UAM) aircraft require catastrophic failure rates for their propulsion systems that are lower than 10-9 failures per flight hour. Electric machines and drives have been identified as limiting propulsion subsystems with failure rates in the range of 10-5 to 10-6 failures per hour. Fault-tolerant (FT) machine drives offers a promising approach to improve reliability using existing technology. A FT Integrated modular motor drive (IMMD) design is proposed for a quadrotor UAM application, and its estimated reliability is studied using Markov chain analysis. Quantitative examples show that raising the repair rate for the motor drive modules significantly reduces the IMMD&amp,#x2019,s catastrophic failure rate. However, the lower bound on its failure rate with high repair rates is determined by its single-point failure (SPF) rate (e.g., motor bearings), highlighting the importance of aggressively suppressing as many of the IMMD&amp,#x2019,s single-point failures as possible. Markov chain analysis shows that single-point failure suppression can result in major reductions in the IMMD catastrophic failure rate by factors exceeding 103 as the SPF rate is driven towards its ideal limit value of zero.

10.2514/6.2022-2741;2022;J.+Wachlin M.+Ward B.+Len M.+Costello A.+Leonard J.+Rogers;Egres: An Emergency Guided Recovery System For Unmanned Aerial Systems;The private eVTOL/UAM market is rapidly expanding, with many companies and investors betting on the possibility of low-cost-to-operate and zero emissions air taxis and last-mile-delivery sUAS dominating the skies of cities in the near future. While fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft regularly operate over populated areas, the envisioned orders-of-magnitude increase in air traffic increases the risk to those on the ground and in the air. The risk calculus is also altered by the novel designs of some eVTOL aircraft. Many designs have neither significant autorotation nor low-speed-gliding capability to land safely in the event of catastrophic power failure. Ballistic parachute systems (ballistic recovery systems), such as those found in increasing use on general aviation aircraft and small UAS (drones) provide some risk mitigation, but provide no control over the landing location, the aircraft will land wherever the wind blows it. Aviation safety experts have noted that while ballistic recovery systems improve safety and should be included on all UAM aircraft, there are still hazards from a vehicle descending uncontrolled under a parachute. This paper covers the analysis and design of a guided emergency recovery system, which uses bleed-air control and a gliding steerable parachute. The analysis shows that due to the use of a parachute which provides lift, rather than a pure drag device, and the use of lightweight bleed-air control, the overall weight of a guided recovery system can be lower than an equivalent ballistic recovery system. A key feature for an effective guided recovery system is selection of its landing point. The development of a massively parallel probabilistic evaluation method for selecting landing points which provide the best likelihood of avoiding hazards is shown with examples. Simulations of EGRES in New York City Urban Air Mobility, UAS interstate highway inspection, and UAS nuclear power plant inspection scenarios showed that EGRES increased the likelihood of landing in an acceptable area by 2.3, 1.8, and 2.9 times respectively, compared with a ballistic parachute recovery system. Finally, a preliminary design for a Group 2 UAS is presented, along with size and weight estimates. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.1177/09576509221106395;2022;H.+Jiang Y.+Zhou H.+W.+Ho;Aerodynamic Design And Evaluation Of A Ducted Fan Lift System For Vertical Takeoff And Landing Flying Cars;Urban air mobility is a relatively new concept that has been proposed in recent years as a means of transporting passengers and goods in urban areas. It encompasses a diverse range of Vertical TakeOff and Landing (VTOL) vehicles that function more like passenger-carrying drones for on-demand transportation. Among them, the car-like VTOL is advantageous due to its compact configuration, safe rotors, high user affinity, and technological fashion. These characteristics are frequently derived from the flying cars Ducted Fan Lift System (DFLS). This study aims to develop a method for the rapid design and the evaluation of the aerodynamic performance of the DFLS, to support the preliminary scheme demonstration of the ducted fan flying car. The proposed method uses blade element theory to design the unducted fan and applies momentum theory to calculate the aerodynamic thrust of the DFLS. The DFLS of a 1:3 scale verifier for a flying car scheme was designed and evaluated using the proposed method and a numerical method, respectively. To validate the proposed method, a prototype of the scale DFLS was manufactured and tested, and the result was compared with those of the proposed theoretical method and the numerical method. This study demonstrates that while both the theoretical and numerical methods are capable of designing an unducted fan accurately, the theoretical method is simpler and faster. Compared to the DFLS test results, the theoretical methods average difference is approximately 1.9%. When evaluating the DFLS, the accuracy of the numerical calculation is reduced, and the difference is greater than 30% at low power. The theoretical method presented in this paper can be used to improve the aerodynamic design and evaluation efficiency of the DFLS and to aid in the configuration evaluation of VTOLs equipped with ducted fans.

As a building block to AAM, the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept envisions highly automated vehicles offering a safe transportation alternative in densely populated, congested metropolitan areas. To accomplish its goal of providing safe autonomous air mobility services in urban areas, the UAM concept will need to ensure a resilient operational environment in which UAM operating and supporting infrastructure systems are fully integrated with existing air transportation systems and enable the secure exchange of data required for UAM operations. This endeavor requires an evaluation of UAM's Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) and cybersecurity requirements to identify operational and cybersecurity barriers that affect the interoperability of UAM operations within the National Airspace System (NAS) ecosystem. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

The potential for UAM is higher in congested cities with substantial commuter populations, but often these cities are served by one or more airports with congested airspaces encompassing over a large part of the urban area. The integration between commercial airspaces and future UAM airspace is among the major challenges to overcome. This study analyzes UAM demand potential with three scenarios of airspace restrictions- No Restrictions, Class-B restrictions only, Class-B/D restrictions. Close to 10 million commuters reside in the New York City area. The city is served by three major commercial airports (JFK, EWR, LGA), making it ideal for this study. A UAM demand estimation framework is built to estimate UAM demand potential for different scenarios. The airspace restrictions significantly affect the UAM demand potential by resulting in less optimal placement of vertiports and increased travel distances. Based on the UAM fares used in the simulation, the airspace restrictions decrease UAM demand by 40% - 57%, compared to the unrestricted scenarios. 2022 IEEE.;N/A

Since 2007, more than half of the world's population has been living in cities, and according to the United Nations that share is projected to rise to 60% by 2030. With a rising population and more cars on the road, travelling across metropolitan areas is increasingly becoming slower and not efficient in terms of energy usage, fuel consumption, and productivity. This significant urban population growth is pushing towards innovative mobility options design, as ground infrastructure becomes increasingly congested. In this framework, a novel transportation concept has been proposed aimed to exploit the vertical dimension in urban transport environment: the Urban Air Mobility (UAM). This paper focuses on the description of the UAM perspectives over the mid-term time horizon, based on the consideration of the expected readiness level of the main enabling technologies for UAM implementation, while also considering aspects related to propulsion, information and communication technologies, infrastructures and U-Space, all of them necessary for the deployment of UAM.

PPP-RTK is expected to become the mainstream positioning solution for various intelligent transportation systems (ITS) such as autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and urban air mobility. Prior studies on PPP-RTK mainly focused on improving navigation accuracy. However, for safety-critical applications, integrity is also an important performance index. Since PPP-RTK is usually implemented using a Kalman filter (KF), the well-known integrity monitoring schemes developed for least-squares-based systems cannot be directly applied to PPP-RTK. After considering the time-sequential nature of KF, we propose a user-end integrity monitoring scheme of PPP-RTK based on multiple hypothesis solution separation (MHSS) to offer high-reliability and high-precision position solutions with real-time integrity information. The proposed scheme includes two key functions: real-time fault detection and rigorous protection level (PL) evaluation. This scheme captures both the faults from PPP-RTK service products and those faults introduced at the user end. Experiments are carried out with real data and simulated fault scenarios. The results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and indicate that multi-constellation PPP-RTK can offer position solutions with decimeter-level PLs (integrity risk: 107/h) in open-sky areas. 2022, Aerospace Information Research Institute.;N/A

In this context, each aerial vehicle would represent an intelligent entity that must be provided with suitable computational, sensing and communication capabilities to cooperate with other similar entities.

The system is one of the upcoming on-demand airborne transportation networks and includes drone taxis and personal air vehicles. The primary purpose of the UAM concept is to use electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles to identify passenger locations, fly and cruise, load the passengers, and deliver them to their destinations. UAM system is a currently evolving field, and multiple concepts such as multi-copter concepts, Lift and Cruise concepts, and Tilt-Wing concepts are being proposed. The behavior of each concept vehicle, and hence its energy efficiency, varies. Using low-altitude airspace, UAM is intended to provide an innovative transportation model for passengers and goods in metropolitan areas with significantly increased mobility. Ground infrastructure incorporating vertiports, regulations, policies, and other vital components, is required to transform UAM from design to operation. Electric flight is thought to be the next step toward more environmentally sustainable air travel. In the present study, a personal air vehicle (PAV) based eVTOL concept is proposed for UAM. The preliminary design and modelling of PAV are discussed here. The aerodynamic performance of propeller characteristics used in PAV design is compared using numerical and experimental studies. The results show that at different velocities, the normal and side forces generated by the propellers are found to be more stable in PAV cruise mode/ forward flight mode, respectively. 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A

In such countries, existing urban transport modes have failed to accommodate the rising travel demand, which means traffic congestion will likely multiply further in the coming years. This distressing situation creates opportunities for automobile and aircraft makers to develop state-of-the-art urban air mobility (UAM) solutions. The electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles seem to represent the future of urban mobility. Commercialized air taxis have the potential to completely disrupt the urban transportation system and relieve the urban streets from congestion. The case discusses the factors facilitating a speedy drift towards adopting air taxis and the recent developments in the UAM industry. To explore the air taxi market opportunities and business feasibility, the case examines the UAM ecosystem, the related cost and technology components, the industry's latest competitive landscape, and anticipated barriers to the successful implementation of the air taxi business. The case outlines allied businesses and complementary revenue streams that the UAM sector would encourage and, thus, help developing nations to grow technologically and economically. 2022, Association for Information Systems.

N/A;2022;H.+.+Aldemir .+ler;Airspace Deregulation For Uam: Self-Organizing Vtols In Metropoles;Small-scale aviation has been driven extensively by recent technological developments. Distinct micro/small scale mobility modes are being interlined, where automated Vertical Take-Off and Landing Aircraft (VTOLs) are being conceptualized for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) in the form of air taxi, cargo, disaster relief, or medical help. This implicates many simultaneous flights over cities, which is a significant challenge. Traditional air traffic control is customized for commercial aviation, and it is not suitable for the dynamic variation in the flight routes of UAM. Consequently, a literature review is conducted firstly for air traffic management subject to UAM. Then, as a critical finding, a self-organizing model integrating particularly micro/small scale UAM is proposed utilizing the swarm concept to leverage the autonomous behavior of VTOLs. Rules for self-organization are set, which are then discussed in conjunction with available technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS) and Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Finally, the basic concept definition is elaborated to determine challenges and future research. 2022, University Aviation Association. All right reserved.;N/A

Alongside the aviation sector, advances in aircraft design and electric propulsion towards sustainability have also emerged in new segments of transportation, the urban air mobility, which has arisen to address the road traffic congestion challenges particularly faced in megacities. Within this new mode of mobility, electric vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts (eVTOLs) have gained interest as a solution for on-demand services, including passenger, cargo transportation, as well as rescue and air ambulances. In this regard, batteries are seen as one of the essential technologies towards decarbonizing the mobility sector. Even though studies have indicated the potential of eVTOLs to enable longer travel distances with significant time savings in comparison with battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the variability in terms of spatial, temporal and technological aspects needs to be addressed in order to assess in how far battery-powered eVTOLs will in fact contribute to a more sustainable urban mobility. Based on a modelling framework of the Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) of future aircraft technologies, this paper investigates the factors contributing to the variability of the environmental assessment results, revealing the inherent complexities of modelling emerging technologies. By simulating different scenarios for the battery operation in eVTOLs and BEVs around the world, a case study demostrates the applicability of the LCE framework in urban and regional application contexts. 2022 Elsevier B.V..

In order to safely integrate the UAS traffic into the congested airspace in the urban area, the current UAS traffic management system proposed by NASA will reserve a static traffic volume for the whole planned trajectory, which is safe but not efficient. In this paper, we propose a dynamic traffic volume reservation method for the UAS traffic management system based on a multi-scale A* algorithm. The planning airspace is represented as a multi-resolution grid, where the resolution will get coarser as the distance to the planning drone gets larger. Therefore, each drone will only need to reserve a temporary traffic volume along the finest flight path in its local area, which helps release the airspace back to others on the far side. Moreover, the multi-scale A* can run nearly in real-time due to a much smaller search space, which enables dynamically rolling planning to consider updated information. The presented numerical results support the advantages of the proposed approach. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc. All rights reserved.;N/A

With the exponential increase predicted in the use of drones over the next 10-20 years, it is essential that the drones are well equipped to handle worst case scenarios such as in the aftermath of a sudden in-flight damage. If the drone has the capability to detect and identify such damage, the drone can decide whether to continue its current mission or land in a safe and controlled manner and it could add another level of safety for flying in densely populated areas and using this ability. Having Control especially when passengers or time critical items are involved is critical in the drone not crashing into something or more importantly someone. Following our original design [1], we propose developing a tool that can detect and categorize damage during flight and in real time, which can potentially be integrated into the onboard flight controller of a UAV. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Comprised of highly complex, safety critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the integration of a UAM system within the National Airspace System (NAS) requires the development of robust control paradigms that are resilient to cyberattacks. In this paper, we consider Denial-of-Service (DoS) cyberattacks and their effects on UAM traffic synchronization and collision avoidance for aerial vehicles within the modeled UAM flight corridor. Network connectivity is essential for the system of UAM vehicles to perform tasks such as distributed optimal control, optimal consensus, or distributed optimization problems, in a collaborative manner. We propose a novel distributed optimization-based control strategy that prompts UAM vehicles, who self-identify as vulnerable, to move towards the centroid of the network to maintain connectivity. We construct a composite interaction network by mixing the redundant information from the communication and auxiliary sensing networks to robustify the communication edge links so that the UAM vehicles are less likely to be vulnerable in the event of a DoS cyberattack. We validate the performance of the proposed control strategy via an illustrative simulation for aerial vehicle traffic synchronization and collision avoidance in the UAM flight corridor, in the presence of DoS cyberattacks. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

The apparent number of these concepts in development has rapidly grown to over 500. The race between eVTOL companies to push their concepts into commercial operation has produced a confidential aircraft development process amongst these manufacturers due to commercial sensitivity. This lack of existing data makes it difficult to carry out conceptual design analysis for eVTOL aircraft. This paper presents the results of the development of a comprehensive mass estimation method for battery-powered eVTOL aircraft in two main configurations, powered lift and wingless. Aircraft component mass estimation methods are adapted from literature on conventional aircraft design synthesis, augmented with rotorcraft power models, which are used to iteratively solve the forward-looking sizing problem using the numerical bisection method. A range sensitivity study showed that for ultra-short missions of 10 km or less, the wingless aircraft becomes more efficient in energy consumption due to its simpler and ultimately lighter airframe structure when sized for very short missions. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

The design, functionality, and application of these aircraft introduce new considerations to the development process. One of these considerations is the sound produced by these new aircraft. Any excessive noise produced by VTOL aircraft could pose a problem in their ability to comply with local noise ordinances. Many designs of new VTOL aircraft include multi-rotor configurations. The spacing of these rotors results in aeroacoustic interactions that have the potential to generate excess noise. As such, it will be important to characterize these interactions to allow for more intelligent design to minimize auditory annoyance. In this study, two rotors were tested in a variety of configurations in order to map out possible flow interactions. Sound data was acquired and analyzed to determine the overall sound pressure level (OASPL) and tonal qualities for each configuration. Variation of the horizontal gap between rotors revealed locations of high aeroacoustic interaction which existed in both overlapping and non-overlapping configurations. Variation of the vertical gap revealed similar findings with certain rotor spacings causing spikes in sound pressure level. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

This framework is a core component of the contingency plan that should be employed in the case of an emergency during flight for UAM and drone transportation. More precisely, our proposed framework can identify the coarse candidate region for the safe landing using deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic segmentation and then determine the refined safety landing zone and estimated position utilizing contour detection, surface flatness and inclination filtering. To verify the performance of the proposed contribution, the simulation was conducted and analyzed, and its result has proven to be valid with respect to both quantitative and qualitative terms. As a result, our proposed framework is capable of not only overcoming the inherent difficulty of image processing in the real world but also significantly improving flight emergency relief performance. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

10.2514/6.2022-1996;2022;M.+A.+Clarke J.+J.+Alonso;Forecasting The Operational Lifetime Of Electric Aircraft Through Battery Degradation Modeling;In recent years, advancements in high energy and power density batteries have become central to the development of viable aircraft for urban air mobility (UAM). In this paper, we introduce the idea of integrating battery lifetime modeling into the assessment of all-electric aircraft meant to service commuter routes, both within polycentric metropolitan regions and between residential and commercial spaces. Four aircraft that represent the major configuration classes of UAM concepts were simulated under continuous operation spanning a period of one year. The aircraft flew eight daily flights, with recharging of the battery pack occurring at the end of each flight. The behavior of aircraft powertrains presented in this study offers a more holistic perspective on the limitations of battery-powered aircraft than other traditional, non-temporal methods. Results from this study highlight that depending on the vehicle configuration, range and battery pack size, the battery life of achievable missions can fall by as much as 45%. Additionally, findings reveal that the rate of change in an operational lifetime can range between 8-23 days per nautical mile flown. The unearthed findings can equip air transportation network modelers with information critical to improving strategies for optimizing vehicle utility to maximize revenue from such a service. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.2514/6.2022-1841;2022;P.+Wu J.+Chen;Comparisons Of Rrt And Mcts For Safe Assured Path Planning In Urban Air Mobility;Urban air mobility (UAM) using electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is an emerging way of air transportation within metropolitan areas. However, the ability to navigate eVTOL aircraft through congested urban air environment poses a great challenge for path planning. For the successful operations of autonomous aerial vehicles in UAM, it is of great importance to take the collision-free requirement into consideration. It is also necessary to consider the presence of various forms of uncertainty in path planning. To address these issues, in this paper the path planning problem is first formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then solved by an online algorithm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) incorporating chance constraints of uncertainty. For the sake of illustration, a high-density free flight airspace simulator is created to test the performance of this proposed algorithm. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that this proposed algorithm outperforms the Chance Constrained Rapidlyexploring Random Tree (CCRRT) Algorithm, a path planning algorithm we proposed before, in terms of many aspects. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.2514/6.2022-1995;2022;O.+Bertram F.+Jger V.+Voth J.+Rosenberg;Uam Vehicle Design With Emphasis On Electric Powertrain Architectures;The research on the system architecture of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles is a vital part within the DLR internal project HorizonUAM. One of the project goals in HorizonUAM is the development of a system concept for an air taxi. This includes research on safe and certifiable onboard systems. The aim of this article is to present results and findings with emphasis on electric powertrain architectures in the multirotor air taxi design. A preliminary design methodology was developed therefor, which enables the examination of full-electric, turbo-electric and hybrid-electric powertrains. This methodology was used in a design study to investigate the influence of different powertrain architectures on the multirotor design. Different evaluation parameters, parameter sweeps and technology exploration of batteries and fuel cell systems were applied to analyze and evaluate their impact on the UAM vehicle design. The main design drivers are the mass of the energy sources and the overall powertrain efficiency, which have a direct impact on the evaluation parameters like power and energy efficiency, maximum take-off mass, and payload fraction. The study showed that different powertrain architectures could lead to opposite vehicle design criteria. Therefore, a clear solution for an advantageous powertrain architecture could not be found. Hybrid-electric solutions, e.g. fuel cell and battery systems or parallel hybrid-electric systems, offer the possibility of increasing efficiency in different flight phases through suitable power management while increasing system complexity. The disadvantage of a high battery mass of a full-electric solution could thus be at least partially reduced. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2022-1509;2022;S.+Deniz Z.+Wang;A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach To Traffic Control At Future Urban Air Mobility Intersections;Today, air traffic controllers communicate with pilots via radio to direct the aircraft. The increasing demand in drone delivery and air mobility will increase air density, which requires highly automated air traffic control systems. To meet the growing demand in air transportation, a high standard autonomous support system is needed. In particular, we need an autonomous air traffic controller to keep the airspace safe and efficient. In this study, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach to handle high-density UAM operations by providing effective guidance to electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles to avoid traffic congestion and reduce travel time. The goal of our MARL approach is to reduce the time at the environed urban air intersections by providing the speed advisories to each approaching vehicle for safe separation at the intersection. The proposed model is trained and evaluated in BlueSky, an open-source air traffic control simulation environment. The results of our simulations with real-world data from thousands of aircraft show that using MARL for the separation problem at the intersection is very promising for solving the problem of en-route air traffic control. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-1415;2022;C.+Harris S.+Kim A.+P.+Payan D.+N.+Mavris;Emergency Planning For Aerial Vehicles By Approximating Risk With Aerial Imagery And Geographic Data;Urban Air Mobility and Advanced Air Mobility require the certification of novel electrified, vertical takeoff and landing, and autonomous aerial vehicles. These vehicles will operate at lower altitudes, in more dense environments, and with limited recovery abilities. Therefore, emergency landing scenarios must be considered broadly to understand the risks in some situations of flight failures. This work provides a preflight planning tool to assist these vehicles when emergency landing is required in crowded environments by fusing geographic data about the population, geometric data from lidar scans, and semantic data about land cover from aerial imagery. The Pix2Pix Conditional GAN is trained on Washington D.C. datasets to predict eight classifications at a 1m resolution. The information from this detection phase is transformed into a costmap, or riskmap, to use in planning the path to the safest landing locations. Multiple combinations of the cost layers are investigated in three test scenarios. The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm efficiently searches for an alternative path that minimizes risk during emergency landing. The tool is demonstrated through three scenarios in the D.C. area. The objective is that the tool allows for the safe operation of UAM and AAM vehicles through crowded regions by providing confidence to the local population and federal regulators. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.2514/6.2022-0888;2022;P.+C.+Schulze J.+R.+Gray D.+H.+Klyde;Proof Of Concept Evaluation Of A Portable Flight Display For Mte Testing;The multitude of new and varied urban air mobility vehicle designs have posed a certification challenge to the aerospace community and regulatory authorities. Ongoing research being conducted by both NASA and the FAA have identified the mission-oriented approach for assessing handling qualities as a means of compliance path for this space. Application of this approach in the more traditional military rotorcraft community heavily leverages physical test courses to assess the vehicle and provide the test pilot the necessary visual cues to complete the task. Given the number of vehicles considering certification, limited access to these existing facilities, and required infrastructure buildup to create a new test facility, an alternative solution for these demonstrations is required. In addition, the potentially limiting battery life of the current generation of vehicles poses new challenges in achieving the number of test points required for development and certification in an efficient manner. To aid these companies in their assessment process, a new cockpit display technology has been developed to permit the assessment of mission task elements while minimizing the infrastructure requirements and facilitate a more efficient test campaign. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

In particular, as autonomous systems continue to grow in both complexity and use throughout UAM concepts the need for simulation environments to both test individual components and systems and to study the complex interactions between them is paramount. In this paper we address design considerations, technologies, and challenges of adapting native simulation environment application concepts to an interactive and distributed web-based framework. The proposed web-based design allows for easier and wider access for developing, testing, integrating, and studying emergent behaviors of complex autonomous systems interaction. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach by showing multi-agent interaction and emergent behavior in two scenarios: (1) autonomous urban air mobility vehicles flying in a convoy and (2) interaction of a convoy with a search and rescue operation. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

10.2514/6.2022-0879;2022;B.+Yuksek G.+Inalhan;Transition Flight Control System Design For Fixed-Wing Vtol Uav: A Reinforcement Learning Approach;Tilt-rotor vertical takeoff and landing aerial vehicles have been gaining popularity in urban air mobility applications because of their ability in performing both hover and forward flight regimes. This hybrid concept leads energy efficiency which is quite important to obtain a profitable and sustainable operation. However, inherent dynamical nonlinearities of the aerial platform requires adaptation capability of the control systems. In addition, transition flight phase should be planned carefully not only for a profitable operation but also for a safe transition between flight regimes in the urban airspace. In this paper, transition flight phase of a tilt-rotor vertical-takeoff-and-landing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is studied. Low-level flight control systems are designed based on adaptive dynamic inversion methodology to compensate aerodynamic effects during the transition phase. Reinforcement learning method is utilized to provide safety and energy efficiency during the transition flight phase. An actor-critic agent is utilized and trained by using deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to augment the collective channel of the UAV. This augmentation on the collective input is used to adjust flight path angle of the UAV which results in adjusting the angle of attack when pitch angle is zero. By using this relationship, it is proposed to generate aerodynamic lift force and perform transition flight with minimum altitude change and energy usage. Simulation results show that the agent reduces the collective signal level as the aerodynamic lift force is created in the descent flight phase. This affects overall system efficiency, reduces operational costs and makes the enterprise more profitable. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc. All rights reserved.;N/A

Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) enables planning over highly nonlinear dynamics using second-order approximations along a nominal trajectory and displays quadratic convergence to a local solution. Model Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) is a stochastic sampling-based algorithm that can optimize for general cost criteria, including potentially highly nonlinear formulations, and supports parallel computation through the use of modern GPU hardware. In this work, DDP was implemented in a model predictive control (MPC) fashion alongside MPPI. The results indicate they are able to successfully transition the aircraft over different flight envelopes and generate trajectories unique to UAM vehicles. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-0623;2022;B.+J.+Bacon;Collision Avoidance Approach Using Deep Reinforcement Learning;A method to enable autonomous robots moving in a 2D space collision free motivates the purposed approach for collision avoidance for autonomous Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Challenges of autonomous collision free navigation for both problems are similar. Agents in each environment do not know the intent, or goal, of the other. Finding the time efficient paths require some level of anticipation with neighboring agents which is computationally expensive. In the original work involving autonomous robots, these obstacles were overcome with a novel application of deep reinforcement learning which offloads the online computation to an offline learning algorithm. A value network that encodes the estimated time to the goal given the agents state and the observable portion of the other agents state is trained on a baseline policy and further refined with reinforcement learning to promote time efficient collision free navigation. Online, the value network efficiently informs the agents decision making in the face of uncertainty of the other agents next move. In this paper, challenges extending this methodology to the 3D environment of autonomous UAM vehicles with kinematic constraints are discussed and initial results shown. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2022-0145;2022;O.+Gur J.+Silver R.+Dt R.+Sundhar;Optimal Design Of Hovering Contra-Rotating Propulsion System;Nowadays we are witness to urban air mobility, UAM, prosperity. Most of it are electric vertical takeoff and landing, eVTOL, vehicles. For these hovering configurations, the use of contra-rotating propellers allows both small dimensions together with sufficient thrust, hence good performance to size compromise. By that, the contra-rotating configuration becomes crucial concerning its performance potential for these vehicles. Unfortunately, performance of contra-rotating configuration is inferior compared to an equivalent single-rotating propeller. Moreover, its acoustic signature is worse, which contradicts the restrictive noise regulation. All of these requires meticulous design of the propulsion system, confronting both its performance and acoustic characteristics. This requires introduction of numerical optimization into the design process, which enables extracting the configuration full potential. Contra-rotating propeller configuration is non-trivial concerning optimal design. This is due to the complex nature of its aerodynamic analysis which implicates also on its noise characteristics. The current effort harnesses several models into unified design framework, which allows optimization of such configuration. The optimization environment is based on ESTECOs modeFRONTIER which incorporates all analysis into the design framework. CFD-based analyses are doomed to fail, as part of optimization procedure, due to its very high computer resource requirement. Thus, aerodynamic analysis is based on simple and effective blade-element model, and acoustic prediction is based on standard discretization of the acoustic wave equation together with super-position of the forward and rear propeller contributions. Electric model and motor/propeller matching are based on electric relations which are implemented twice for each propeller in the contra-rotating configuration. As part of CRAFT  contra-rotating analysis, fabrication, and test venture, an optimized CR configuration are designed. The paper will present the design process and its outcomes-optimized contra-rotating configuration, with minimal penalty compared to the single-rotating option. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The steady coefficients of aerodynamic forces and surface distributions of pressure and shear stress were predicted at a free stream Mach number of 0.3, a moderate Reynolds number of 3.5 million, and at three angles of attack (AOA) of 0, 2, and 4 degrees. The study showed that the aerodynamic coefficients from all the three methods had a good match at zero AOA. However, as expected, the predictions of aerodynamic forces by the vortex panel method increasingly deviated from the RANS and IDDES methods at larger AOA conditions. Such a discrepancy was caused by the significantly different pressure distributions over the vehicle body, especially at the canard and main wing. Given that the flow was marginally separated up to a AOA of 4 degrees, RANS and IDDES gave very similar predictions of both aerodynamic forces and surface distributions of pressure and shear stress. 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Accordingly, many institutions and companies around the world are developing UAM vehicles, building infrastructure, and re-searching flight operating systems. In this study, three holding area concepts have been designed that can control air traffic flows and avoid bad weather conditions when UAM vehicles are oper-ating. These holding areas have been considered to allow UAM vehicles to fly by avoiding colli-sions with other UAM vehicles or structures such as buildings. After validating the turning radius analysis with existing aircraft, a case study on the holding area concept design for the Seoul GyungIn area was performed to determine whether UAM vehicles can turn within a narrow radi-us. It was not possible for winged-type UAM vehicles to turn across the Han River at cruise speed.

This necessitates an approach to identify the safety requirements for the increasingly autonomous system (IAS) as well as a framework and techniques to verify and validate that an IAS meets its safety requirements. We use Crew Resource Management techniques to identify requirements and behaviors for safe human-machine teaming behaviors. We provide a methodology to verify that an IAS meets its requirements. We apply the methodology to a case study in Urban Air Mobility, which includes two contingency scenarios: unreliable sensor and aborted landing. For this case study, we implement an IAS agent in the Soar language that acts as a copilot for the selected contingency scenarios and performs takeoff and landing preparation, while the pilot maintains final decision authority. We develop a formal human-machine team architecture model in the Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL), with operator and IAS requirements formalized in the Assume Guarantee REasoning Environment (AGREE) Annex to AADL. We formally verify safety requirements for the human-machine team given the requirements on the IAS and operator. We develop an automated translator from Soar to the nuXmv model checking language and formally verify that the IAS agent satisfies its requirements using nuXmv. We share the design and requirements errors found in the process as well as our lessons learned. Bhattacharyya, Davis, Gupta, Narayan, & Matessa.;N/A

The demand for safe and efficient mobility of people and goods is growing rapidly, in line with the growth in population in US urban centers. In response, new technologies to meet these urban mobility demands are also rapidly maturing in preparation for future full-scale deployment. As surface congestion increases and the technology surrounding unmanned aerial systems (UAS) matures, more people are looking to the urban airspace and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) as a piece of the puzzle to promote mobility in cities. However, the lack of coordination between UAS stakeholders, federal UAS safety regulations, and researchers developing UAS algorithms continues to be a critical barrier to widespread UAS adoption. FADS takes into account federal UAS safety requirements, UAM challenge scenarios, contingency events, as well as stakeholder-specific operational requirements. FADS formalizes these requirements, through Signal Temporal Logic (STL) representations, and a trajectory planning optimization for multi-rotor UAS fleets guarantees robust and continuous-time satisfaction of the requirements and mission objectives. The intuitive FADS user interface makes it easy to plan missions in a variety of environments, we demonstrate this through several rural and urban environment-based case studies. FADS holistically integrates high-level stakeholder objectives with low-level trajectory planning, combined with a user-friendly interface, FADS reduces the complexity of stakeholder coordination within the UAM context. 2021 Elsevier Ltd;N/A

The exponential growth unmanned aerial systems have provided many new opportunities such as urban air mobility. With the imminent entrance of unmanned aerial systems to the national airspace aircraft will be flying at lower heights over people and properties and will be landing in spatially constraint landing fields. This paper introduces cognitive autolanding algorithms, where the standard landing stages of flare, glideslope, and approach, are employed to land the aircraft safely and within time, spatial, and aircraft dynamic constraints. The use of Dubins paths during the approach stage is explored and employed in this work showing how the algorithms can be used to direct the aircraft towards any landing field from adverse initial headings and positions. The autolanding generated path is then flown in a six-degrees-of-freedom simulation environment.

In that sense, Europe launched U-space initiative to enable the integration of thousands of drones into the skies. However, Unmanned Aerial Systems technology and their framework need to reach highest level of maturity to face the safety challenges arising from their implementation. The objective of this paper is to assess the State-of-the-art of the U-space and Air Traffic Management regulatory framework in Europe, describe the main challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure a safe and efficient integration of drones into the European airspace and finally, propose the next steps to define concrete actions and solutions to face the identified challenges. The analysis concludes that the current framework is not mature enough to address some of the emerging challenges identified, especially regarding the application of safety assessment methodologies in urban environments, where dense unmanned traffic and low-level operations generate a disruptive scenario. In order to face them, it is key to create safety metrics and operational insights using data from high-fidelity large-scale simulations followed by controlled flight demonstrations in sandbox environments. In addition, systems safety assessment methodologies should follow an iterative approach that assigns different assurance levels to each service depending on the criticality of their involvement in the operation. Future work should include the use of resilience engineering techniques to mitigate the risks linked to autonomous systems and a balanced usage of Artificial Intelligence, which benefits at medium/long term will overcome the initial safety challenges. 2021 IEEE.;N/A
10.5659/JAIK.2021.37.6.149;2021;N/A;Prediction Of Urban Spatial Structure Change In Seoul Metropolitan Area According To The Introduction Of Urban Air Mobility (Uam)-Focusing On The Distribution Of Relative Housing Prices In Seoul Metropolitan Area;Recently, the traffic congestion problem is intensifying in cities due to the high population density and the increase of vehicles. As a solution to alleviate traffic congestion, the concept of UAM was introduced as a new means of transportation. UAM has a big difference from means of existing transportation in that it uses airspace. The introduction of UAM will significantly shorten the travel time between regions, and thus will have a great influence on the urban spatial structure. The purpose of this study is to predict and analyze changes in the urban spatial structure of the metropolitan area following the introduction of UAM, focusing on the distribution of housing prices. The research method analyzes the influence of variables on the current housing price through the hedonic price model. And it is to use this to predict changes in the distribution of housing prices, assuming the introduction of UAM. The analysis results are as follows. First, the gap in housing prices has decreased. Second, the quality of housing improved. Third, the urban spatial structure was formed in a more balanced manner. The results of this study suggest that the gap in housing prices between regions in the metropolitan area can be alleviated through the introduction of UAM. In the future, it can be used for follow-up research to understand the impact of UAM introduction on urban spatial structure. 2021 Architectural Institute of Korea.;N/A
10.1016/j.trc.2021.103116;2021;J.+Cho Y.+Yoon;Extracting The Topology Of Urban Airspace Through Graph Abstraction;With the rapid adoption of the operational concept of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in urban airspace, there is an increased focus on the spatial extent that Unmanned Aircraft (UA) can safely navigate. Urban airspace is full of intrinsic risks associated with several factors, including but not limited to unpredictable microclimates, radio-frequency disturbances and electro-magnetic interferences. For safe and efficient use of airspace, it is imperative to proactively assess the availability of airspace volumes to accommodate large-scale operations. In this paper, we highlight that urban airspace is a unique environment where highly obstructed (complex topology) and sparsely structured (simple topology) regions coexist. The presence of static obstacles and required separation from those obstacles create particular spatial structures, such as narrow passages, islands and funnels, throughout the airspace. Considering that not only throughput capacity of airspace but also complexity of path planning is highly dependent on the topology of a navigable space, we propose a new airspace assessment approach to extract the topology of airspace using computational geometry techniques. We focus on identifying geospatial locations suitable for high density UAS operations as well as examining spatial contiguity between those locations in highly urbanized areas. In doing so, we define segment as an airspace region that is wide enough for multiple vehicles to simultaneously pass through. Low-altitude urban airspace is abstracted into a compact and informative graph structure called segment graph that summarizes segment connectivity in the horizontal and vertical dimension. The proposed method shows that the geometry of low-altitude airspace is fundamentally different from that of conventional high-altitude airspace and can provide a useful basis for airspace design and management within low-altitude urban environments. 2021;N/A
10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3066887;2021;W.+A.+Lies L.+Narula P.+A.+Iannucci T.+Humphreys;Long Range, Low Swap-C Fmcw Radar;A method is developed, analyzed, and tested to adapt low-cost, automotive-grade radar chipsets for long-range sensing. These disruptive chipsets offer impressive performance at low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) that could benefit applications with tight SWaP-C budgets such as urban air mobility and urban air logistics. The short range of these radars currently prevents their deployment in long-range applications, so this paper employs extended measurement intervals coupled with sophisticated motion modeling and signal processing to significantly extend their range. After deriving the optimal maximum likelihood estimator, the paper presents suboptimal, more efficient techniques for target range estimation that are robust to target motion uncertainty. These techniques are validated in simulation and demonstrated via experiment. The results show that low SWaP-C radar chipsets are capable of operating at low SNR to perform long-range sensing when augmented with this paper's motion modeling and signal processing techniques. This potent combination of low SWaP-C hardware and advanced signal processing will drive innovation in urban air mobility, urban air logistics, and other areas in need of long-range sensing. 2007-2012 IEEE.;N/A

There is a long research and development history for compound vehicle, but remain rare studies on the full-mode flight control. In this work, a UAV compound with double-mode rotor and wing is introduced and typical flight profile and flight stage division of the UAV are described. Then flight dynamics model of the UAV is built based on explicit blade element method. And a robust adaptive full-mode control scheme is designed based on adaptive neural network augmented nonlinear dynamic inversion. The derivative-free adaptive strategy is adopted to achieve fast adaption. A control allocator is designed based on the dynamic allocation method to coordinate the rotor and the aerodynamic surfaces. Simulation results illustrate superior full-mode flight control performance of the proposed scheme. 2021 IEEE.;N/A
10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441577;2021;L.+Sherry J.+Baldo B.+Berlin;Design Of Flight Guidance And Control Systems Using Explainable Ai;Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of Flight Guidance and Control Systems (FG&CS) using Machine Learning (ML) from large archives of operational flight data. As the scope of the missions of drones/Small Unmanned Airborne Systems (sUAS) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles increase (e.g. operations beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) over people), the need for proof-of-compliance for safety regulations is required. Approaches to meet the regulatory airworthiness requirements for software assurance, such as those embodied in DO-178, require coverage of paths through the code. This path coverage requirement can be achieved by a sub-class of ML, known as Explainable ML (X-ML) that enables the derivation of formal models, such as Situation-Goal-Behavior Models (SGBM), from the ML FG&CS. This paper describes the results of a case-study of the development of an X-ML FG&CS that highlights the limits of an X-ML only approach and the need for a Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) analysis and design to complete the design to meet safety performance standards. The case study identified, specifically, the presence of five design error archetypes. These design error archetypes can be eliminated (i.e. addressed) by analysis of the SGBM using Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) Tools as described in this paper. The implications and limitations of this approach for developing airworthy FG&CS are discussed. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

Such issue could be overcome by developing modified generations of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles that essentially depend on the Vertical and/or Short Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) feature to increase the efficiency of landing capabilities on limited- space parking areas. The complexity of integrating an efficient and safe V/STOL feature in such UAM vehicles is notably difficult comparing with the conventional and normal techniques for landing and take-off. The efficient V/STOL feature should be carried out by a complete and collaborative Cyber-Physical System (CPS) processing architecture, such as the CPS-5C architecture. In this paper, we only proposed two CPS-5C physical layers of a V/STOL Autonomous Landing Guidance Assistant System (ALGAS2) processing unit to increase the reliability of the vertical landing mechanism. The proposed V/STOL - ALGAS2 system depends on Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) as the advanced control unit. Furthermore, the proposed ALGAS2 system depends on four symmetric and segregated processing ALGAS2 cores that processing the data in a fully parallel and independent manner to enhance many essential security and safety factors for the futuristic UAM vehicles. The proposed ALGAS2 digital circuits architecture has been designed using MATLAB and VHDL. Also, it has been further analyzed for the implementation and validation tests using the Intel Altera OpenVINO FPGA board. The proposed ALGAS processing unit attained a maximum computational processing performance of about 21.22 Giga Operations per Seconds (GOPS). 2021 IEEE.;N/A

This problem is particularly relevant in the development of autonomous vehicles, especially in the concept of urban air mobility. The actual usage of the vehicle will be used to predict stresses in the structure and therefore to define maintenance scheduling. Supervised regression machine learning algorithms are used to map a reduced set of data coming from real-time measurements of a structure into a detailed/high-fidelity finite element analysis (FEA) model of the same system, therefore creating a surrogate of the finite element model. The paper will present applications of the approach to a one-dimensional beam structure, modeled with finite element methods. Based on the response of the beam measured at a few reference locations, the surrogate finite element approach determines the entire response of the beam at all spatial locations (displacements, velocities, accelerations, stresses, strains) using neural networks. The FEA-based machine learning approach estimates the stress distribution over the entire system during operations, thus improving the ability to define ad-hoc, safe and efficient maintenance procedures. The effect of type of input features and output and their relationship on the performance of the neural network is discussed, as well as the effect of the beam boundary conditions on network performance. 2021 Structural Health Monitoring 2021: Enabling Next-Generation SHM for Cyber-Physical Systems - Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring, IWSHM 2021.

Moreover, it monitors the situation in ports and peri-port areas, providing timely, valuable and effective information to both private users and port authorities.

N/A;2021;F.+Zeng H.+R.+Idris J.+P.+Clarke;Trajectory Planning For Mission Survivability Of Autonomous Vehicles In Moderately To Extremely Uncertain Environments;Trajectory planning is a particularly challenging task for autonomous vehicles when there are moderate to extreme uncertainties in their operating environment, i.e., where the trajectories of hazards are partially known to completely unknown. In this paper, we propose a receding horizon control strategy with novel trajectory planning policies that enable dynamic updating of the planned trajectories of autonomous vehicles. The proposed policies utilize two metrics: (1) the number of feasible trajectories, and (2) the robustness of the feasible trajectories. We measure the effectiveness of the suggested policies in terms of mission survivability, which is defined as the probability that the primary mission is accomplished or, if that is not possible, the vehicle lands safely at an alternative site. We show that a linear combination of both metrics is an effective objective function when there is a mix of partially known and unknown uncertainties. When the operating environment is dominated by unknown disturbances, maximizing the number of feasible trajectories results in the highest mission survivability. These findings have significant implications for achieving safe aviation autonomy. ATM 2021. All rights reserved.;N/A

In this paper, we apply MuZero, a newly-introduced deep reinforcement learning algorithm by DeepMind [1] to path planning problems in dynamic air traffic environments. MuZero has demonstrated exceptional progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) game playing. To formulate the path planning problem, we consider a sequential trajectory allocation approach that would act on a first-come-first-serve basis for both online planning and moving time horizon problems. Initial results show that agents can learn to mitigate collisions when trained with the obstacle avoidance framework based on the MuZero algorithm without requiring any knowledge about the domain and game rules. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Flight path management (FPM) is a major category of automation functionality needed to achieve this vision. FPM will provide dynamic management of an aircrafts flight path, ensuring that it continues to meet five objectives: it is feasible to fly to mission completion, deconflicted from hazards, coordinated with other traffic, flexible to accommodate future disturbances, and optimized to meet business objectives. While efforts are underway to advance FPM technology for the Urban Air Mobility application, the authors present initial design guidelines for FPM automation capabilities to achieve each of its five objectives based on 15 years of prior FPM automation research and development. We describe methods to efficiently account for uncertainty in the prediction of trajectories and discuss additional considerations for prioritizing safety in the design of FPM automation capabilities and interactions between aircraft. We make recommendations supported by extensive experience gained via previous work with the Autonomous Operations Planner, an FPM reference automation system developed by NASA. By employing capable FPM automation supported by cooperative operational flight rules and information sharing, future aircraft operators will benefit from an increased ability to plan and execute safe and efficient flights to achieve mission success in a dynamic airspace. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.2514/6.2021-2325;2021;Y.+Xie A.+Gardi R.+Sabatini;Hybrid Ai-Based Demand-Capacity Balancing For Uas Traffic Management And Urban Air Mobility;With the gradual diffusion of commercial Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) operations, UAS transportation and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) services are expected to thrive at low altitudes in cities. The operation of multiple manned and unmanned aircraft may cause airspace capacity overload in dense metropolitan regions in the future. Such congestion and imbalance will reduce the efficiency and safety of operations. Therefore, UAS Traffic Management (UTM) systems will crucially need to provide Demand Capacity Balancing (DCB) services for low-altitude airspace to reduce the criticality of human operators' intervention. This paper proposes a UTM system framework based on a hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm, which supports a resilient and flexible DCB process and solution framework, hence meeting the stringent operational requirements of urban low-altitude airspace. The hybrid AI algorithm includes a training data generation component which trains and optimizes the decision-making model, improving the decision-making performance of the system. A preliminary verification case study is presented, highlighting the capability of the system to generate multiple feasible solutions to airspace congestion problems. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

10.2514/6.2021-2265;2021;Y.+Shi W.+Kollmann;Parameter Study Of A Porous Trailing Edge Using Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation;Trailing-edge noise results from interactions between turbulent eddies and a sharp trailing edge. Trailing-edge noise has attracted significant research interest recently because of three main reasons: (1) it potentially holds the noise floor of an advanced, low-noise airplane, (2) it is a dominant noise source in wind turbines which have rapidly expanded in the last two decades, (3) it is one of the roadblocks for the certification of urban air mobility. One way to reduce trailing-edge noise is by using porous materials due to their ability to absorb acoustic energy. Although it has been proven a viable method for trailing-edge noise reduction according to numerous experimental and numerical studies, the impacts of the position of a porous region are still unknown. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive parameter study where a porous material is placed at different streamwise positions or sides of an airfoil. It is shown that noise reduction with four different porous configurations ranges from 1.8 dB to 11.9 dB without compromising the aerodynamic performance in general. Meanwhile, it is found that a porous trailing edge does not significantly change the hydrodynamic field. Instead, two unique noise reduction mechanisms are identified. Overall, the current research gives insight into the design of a porous trailing edge. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2021-2339;2021;H.+S.+Glaudel R.+W.+Ghatas;Establishing The Framework For Evtol Flight Mission Scenario Development For Urban Air Mobility Research Using Cognitive Task Analysis;This paper focuses on applying specific protocol aspects of Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) methods to formulate non-routine flight mission use-case scenarios in support of a potential research study at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center under the Air Traffic Management  eXploration (ATM-X) Urban Air Mobility (UAM) sub-project. The objective of use-case scenarios is to provide a hypothetical situation to elicit expert knowledge and feedback in a specific subject matter area. Use-case scenarios in the field of aviation, including UAM, can help to support the safe integration of these vehicles into the National Airspace System (NAS) through the examination of airspace procedures during non-routine events. Inherent in this type of research is the need to study in-flight non-routine scenarios that the UAM vehicle could encounter. Situations categorized as non-routine events are any events that occur outside of the original flight plan such as a mechanical malfunction or other in-flight emergency requiring special procedures, which can include diversions to a specified, or non-specified, emergency landing area. In specific instances, some non-routine events could be considered as routine during in-flight operations, such as the need to perform a go-around due to a balked landing. As the rate of technological expansion surrounding UAM grows rapidly in modern aviation, so does the need for research that focuses on the safe integration of these vehicles including research with a focus on the methods and development of airspace operational procedures. Research rooted in CTA methods provides a framework for developing use-case scenarios appropriate for environments where mental demands are substantial. Substantial mental demands exist while operating in the NAS for pilots, airline dispatchers, and air traffic controllers among many others. With the focus on UAM in mind, it is critical to frame a baseline use-case scenario using information as it pertains to current-day airspace operations. According to Dr. Robert R. Hoffmans Protocols for Cognitive Task Analysis, one of the first steps to applying CTA methods to research is the concept of bootstrapping in which the researcher(s) familiarize themselves with the domain that is being studied. To formulate the non-routine flight mission use-case scenarios for the purpose of this potential NASA ATM-X UAM research study, and to inform the baseline use-case scenario, the practice of bootstrapping was utilized to acquire knowledge of current-day airspace procedures. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

As presently envisioned, these operations will take place squarely in the urban boundary layer (UBL), a new environment for sustained aviation operations. Due to the heterogeneity of the surface underlying the UBL and the roughness elements within it, along with other complex processes, the UBL is a spatially and temporally dynamic environment. Due to these characteristics and the new aircraft being developed to fly within it, this flight environment will have to be meteorologically resolved at fine scales. The potential of crowdsourced data has only begun to be realized in weather forecasting but may be especially well suited for this purpose. This paper proposes an overarching architecture for a cyber-physical urban meteorological observational system to support burgeoning UAM operations. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

This work extends our prior research on developing an impedance-based complexity metric for unmanned aircraft system traffic scenario classification. Impedance-based metric was evaluated for 1045 randomly-generated scenarios. Scenarios with overall impedance above a certain threshold were declared as not feasible. A ground-delay-based approach was developed to be applied to the rest of the scenarios so as to remediate any scenarios with small areas of high impedance on their impedance maps. A sample application is shown for a scenario with sixty flights. The detailed trade-offs between overall accrued system delay, the number of delayed flights, the total number of conflicts and the highest impedance observed as a function of the delay tolerance for each aircraft are provided. Potential applications to Urban Air Mobility traffic scenarios are also discussed. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.. All rights reserved.;N/A

The introduction of UAM operations into the airspace, however, brings challenges related to the efficient and equitable management of UAM air traffic, particularly with regards to trajectory assignment and optimization. Near-term UAM missions are anticipated to operate within structured airspace corridors, leading to the interesting problem of corridor formation. In this paper, we describe a minimum cost, network flow optimization framework that provides global optimal corridors for a given set of origin-destination pairs, subject to airspace metrics such as airspace density, complexity, and flexibility. The framework is applied to both small-scale scenarios that demonstrate the behavior of the framework, and a full-scale scenario representative of the Atlanta metropolitan area.

This paper describes enabling aspects of potential operations in the near term, conceptually in the first ten years of UAM operation in the US. UAM vehicles will land and take-off at defined vertiports and airports, flying at low altitudes, through B, C, D, and E airspace. Urban air vehicles will share the airspace with conventional piloted aircraft and, in the low altitude, urban airspace, with emerging small, unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). FAAs UAM CONOPS posits operation in urban air corridors under Community Based Rules. Even assuming VFR operation in these corridors, there are multiple urban air vehicle communication needs in the corridor. These communications face constraints of identifying available frequencies, achieving appropriate range, ascertaining quality of service, then implementation and management of the communications. Building on a year-long study of CNS recommendations for UAM under UML-4 that this team completed for NASA in 2020, this paper explores the requirements and constraints of communications and surveillance in near term corridors. We examine the alternatives recommended in the 2020 NASA report and compare them to the requirements under FAAs UAM CONOPS and UAM corridors, identifying issues for resolution and research. Even given the constraints and unknowns of UAM operations, we found several viable options for CNS, which are presented in this paper. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

As platforms and the infrastructure for UAS also mature, they can provide new potential tools for weather data collection. For UAM to be safe and feasible, knowledge of air currents between tall buildings and terrain and other urban area specific weather effects will need to be available to UAM pilots. Numerous sources for weather data and forecasts are available to all pilots today, but UAS operators (and future UAM pilots/operators) were not considered in the design of our current methods for communicating weather information. Recent advancements in UAS provide both new opportunities and new challenges with respect to obtaining and communicating weather data. In the research presented in this paper, we identify similarities and differences in the weather needs and use of General Aviation (GA) pilots and UAS operators, and initiate the data collection process to provide decision makers and UAS/instrumentation designers with a set of needs we can address. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

This research proposes a method for a scenario-based estimation of urban air mobility (UAM) vehicle demand. In order to assess the potential development pathways for VTOL vehicle demand multiple steps have been taken.

The method assumes UAM market penetration rates to differ over the four dimensions. Trip lengths, demand distribution over the day and the overall number of trips that could potentially be substituted by UAM trips vary per use-case and city archetype. Using existing mobility data allows to compute specific numbers and to relate them to numbers from existing studies in the field. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Future huge fleets of logistic UAVs need to be optimized in terms of high efficiency and low annoyance, and hence, require sophisticated design methodologies. This paper presents a conceptual design methodology and its related tool to support the study of UAVs throughout the early design phase. This supporting ability is accomplished through the adjustment and the update of the traditional aircraft and rotorcraft design methods and the implementation of an ad-hoc UAV database into the design sequence. Special attention is dedicated to the Mass Estimation model as it shows the main deviation from the classical aircraft design methods. The presented methodology is capable to deal with a variety of potential UAV concepts such as rotorcraft-derived and hybrid configurations, targeting a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capability. With this design methodology being validated, it may be applied to novel VTOL designs, allowing trade-off analyses to identify reasonable design spaces and select the best-suited configuration for the given design scope. In this work, the case study examined is a freight UAV as part of a green air cargo logistics chain.

While many of the aircraft developed for this concept have focused on vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, it has been demonstrated that fixed-wing aircraft using distributed electric propulsion (DEP) powered lift systems might be able to operate under similarly-constrained environments as short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft. While DEP powered lift is not a new concept, design and analysis tools remain underdeveloped for this purpose because the data needed to validate such methods does not exist. In this paper, a series of wind tunnel surveys were conducted on several configurations of a quasi-2D blown-flap airfoil to enhance understanding of their performance characteristics and generate the validation data needed for future computational analysis. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2021-3304;2021;J.+Swanke T.+M.+Jahns;Reliability Analysis Of A Fault-Tolerant Integrated Modular Motor Drive (Immd) For An Urban Air Mobility (Uam) Aircraft Using Markov Chains; Electrified Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft require catastrophic failure rates that are lower than 10-9 failures per flight hour. Electric machines and drives have been identified as limiting component subsystems with failure rates in the vicinity of 10-6 failures per hour. Fault-tolerant (FT) machine drives offers a promising approach to improve reliability using existing technology. A FT Integrated Modular Motor Drive (IMMD) design is proposed for a quadrotor UAM application, and its estimated reliability is studied using Markov chains. It is shown that the lower bound on its catastrophic failure rate is limited to its single-point failure rate (e.g., bearings) when a rapid repair strategy is applied. This insight highlights the importance of aggressively minimizing the IMMDs single-point failure rate. Markov analysis shows how suppression of single-point failures results in major reductions in the IMMD failure rate exceeding 1000x as the single-point failure rate is driven towards its ideal limiting value of zero. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Both industry and academic effort has been aimed towards predicting and simulating fleet activity for the purpose of informing vehicle design decisions and infrastructure planning activities. However, little effort has been targeted at analyzing aircraft fleet performance and sensitivity to pilot decision making, infrastructure availability, and changing vehicle characteristics. In this work, we utilize an existing proprietary, industry developed, discrete-event simulation tool that calculates air vehicle fleet performance with user specified vehicle and demand parameters. Building on this simulation, we then apply an optimization and sensitivity analysis, identifying the relative importance of different vehicle parameters, network attributes, decision making policies, and demand characteristics as they ultimately relate to objective functions that aim to maximize vehicle utilization and minimize the number of deadhead trips. The result of this analysis will inform critical requirements of the UAM market and highlight the importance of effective vehicle scheduling in a UAM scenario. Copyright 2021 by ASME.;N/A

Since its commercial launch in 2013, the technology produced all the carbon fiber body panels for General Motors C-7 Corvette. Until recently, high tooling costs and limited advancements in fast-curing prepreg systems has limited its adoption in markets outside the automotive industry. The program described in this paper sought to combine the rapid curing system with innovative tooling approaches and rapid curing prepreg systems to advance the readiness and meet the needs of the emerging urban air mobility market. Significant revisions were also made to the machine to provide multi-directional heating to further improve cycle times. Solvays CYCOM EP2750 is a fast-curing resin system formulated for high-rate composite manufacturing selected for this study.

Position sensor is one of major maintenance target in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), since it is under hostile environments. As the sensor backup, sensorless algorithms are often used. In this work, sensorless algorithm and resolver work in cooperative and surveilling mode to each other. Based on the PMSM model, Runge-Kutta method is utilized to predict currents under two different position. These currents are compared with the real current measurements, and the result points to the angle suspected of being defective. Simultaneously, the deviation between the resolver sensor and the sensorless angle is always monitored. As this deviation, i.e. the angle error, increases, the weight of the suspected angle continuously decreases. Also, the fault is flagged when corresponding error exceeds a threshold value. In this work, a smooth transition is achieved thanks to logistic function-based weighting and sensor fusion The proposed method is verified through simulations and experiments. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

The reason: new developments in nonaviation industries are driving technological progress in aviation. For instance electrical motors, modern sensor technologies and better energy storage expand the possibilities and enable novel vehicle concepts which require also novel system architectures for flight control systems. Their development is governed by aviation authority and industry recognized standards, guidelines and recommended practices. Comprehensive methods for Model-Based Systems Engineering exist which address these guidance materials but their setup and their application can be quite resource-demanding. Especially the new and rather small key players - start-ups and development teams in an educational environment - can be overwhelmed to setup such development processes. For these clients, the authors propose a custom workflow for the development of system architectures. It shall ensure development rigor, quality and consistency. The authors show how the custom workflow has been established based on the ARP4754A and its level of compliance to the standard's process objectives. Based on automation of life cycle activities, manual effort can be reduced to allow the application even in small teams. The custom workflow's activities are explained and demonstrated within a case study of an Experimental Autopilot system architecture. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

A big challenge is that these new aerial vehicles will quickly saturate the already crowded aviation spectrum, which is an essential resource to ensure reliable communications for safe operations. In this paper, we consider an air transportation system where multiple aerial vehicles are operated to transport passengers or cargo from different sources to destinations along their pre-defined paths. During the flight, the minimum communication Quality of Service (QoS) requirement must be achieved to ensure flight safety. Our objective is to minimize the average mission completion time by jointly optimizing the velocity selection and spectrum allocation for all aerial vehicles. We formulate the optimization problem as a multi-stage Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the optimization variables are coupled together. A multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based solution is proposed where Value Decomposition Networks (VDN) algorithm is utilized to take discrete actions. Additionally, we propose a heuristic greedy algorithm as a baseline solution. Simulation results show that our learning based solution outperforms the heuristic greedy algorithm and another Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) solution in minimizing the mission completion time. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

This feat is largely due to technological advances and stringent regulations that yield an under-utilized national airspace. However, as the air transportation system (ATS) evolves to support a new class of vehicles, known as urban air mobility (UAM) systems, airspace utilization will increase and a new set of safety requirements will be needed to sustain, or preferably improve, ATS' safety record. This paper addresses this safety challenge with a novel process for developing and testing safety standards. It outlines and demonstrates a high-performance computing (HPC) process for large-scale high-fidelity UAM simulations. The developed HPC process incorporates automated air traffic control (ATC) services, which have been proposed in the unmanned traffic management (UTM) system. In addition to outlining a process for gathering UAM performance and safety data, this paper more generally contributes a novel blueprint for performing high-fidelity simulations of a large set of autonomous UAM systems that concurrently fly in an urban environment. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

The model inherently accounts for the performance of Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) systems, as well as aircraft vehicle dynamics in evaluating collision risk. The model is applicable to encounters between two or more aircraft, and to terrain collision scenarios. The methodology is underpinned by modelling of the CNS error characteristics, as well as wind uncertainty, and the translation of those characteristics to the spatial domain to form a virtual risk protection volume around each aircraft. The volume is then inflated in proportion to a Target Level of Safety (TLS). The methodology is demonstrated in a simulation case study representative of aircraft-aircraft collision encounters. A 2 navigation accuracy bound of 185.2 m was found to incur a maximum collision risk of approximately 1.510-4 at a separation of 200m. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

In this feasibility study, the use of multi-rotor electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) is considered and findings on the cross-border visitor statistics between Singapore-Malaysia and Singapore-Indonesia are shared to reflect the potential demand for cross-border transportation. The points of interest for each of the countries are also identified, and the various existing common modes of transport used for cross-border journeys with their associated fares and duration are presented. To evaluate the feasibility of cross-border UAM from Singapore, an analysis of its journey duration gains and tradeoffs are compared against that of conventional modes of transportation to project an estimated fare for UAM services. The study then concludes with the challenges and limitations to determine if and how UAM would be a feasible option for cross-border transportation into and out of Singapore in the near future. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

SIRIUS is being developed under the auspices of the NASA Air Traffic Management eXploration project, UAM subproject (ATM-X UAM). SIRIUS provides an intuitive, highly configurable graphical user interface to design complex traffic scenarios and airspace configurations representative of conceptual UAM operations. Aircraft simulated with SIRIUS can be equipped with flight-tested capabilities for detect and avoid (DAA), geofencing, distributed merging and spacing, path conformance, and path planning while executing time-constrained, 4D trajectories generated by a UAM ground operations system. Central to the design of the SIRIUS simulation framework is the capability to evaluate the integration and interoperability of ground-based separation services (e.g., strategic separation) with extended DAA functionality (e.g., path monitoring, separation provision, merging and spacing, etc.) The simulation environment also supports modelling of wind, navigation, and sensor uncertainties, as well as communication delays.

This is evident in the context of emerging UAS Traffic Management (UTM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operational paradigms, where a transition from Human-in-the-Loop to Human-on-the-Loop is required. As the nature of UAS/UAM traffic is inherently heterogeneous and rapidly changing, the resulting levels of complexity are expected to be much higher than in traditional ATM operations. Such complexity can be at least in part addressed by introducing suitable traffic clustering schemes to improve operational efficiency and reduce computational overheads. Traffic clustering algorithms typically adopted in flow management problems utilise aircraft trajectory data as a primary feature variable. However, this approach is not the most adequate for UAS traffic clustering because their mission profiles are affected by various factors, such as weight class, type of mission, and Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) capabilities. Therefore, a multi-criteria traffic clustering methodology is proposed in this paper, which provides a new, versatile and computationally efficient approach suitable for traffic flow optimisation in next generation DSS for UTM/UAM operations. A preliminary verification of the proposed clustering methodology is performed based on synthetic UAS/UAM traffic data around Melbourne's inner suburbs. Our preliminary analysis demonstrates that the proposed multi-criteria clustering methodology is numerically feasible and can efficiently support diverse operational UTM/UAM scenarios. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

In UAM, an aircraft can operate in the corridors, i.e., the designated airspace, that link the aerodromes, thus avoiding the use of complex routing strategies such as those of modern-day helicopters. For safety, a UAM aircraft will use air-to-ground communications to report flight plan, off-nominal events, and real-time movements to ground base stations (GBSs). A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables UAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe transportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity performance in UAM, a stochastic geometry-based spatial model is developed. In particular, the distribution of GBSs is modeled as a Poisson point process (PPP), and the aircraft are distributed according to a combination of PPP, Poisson cluster process (PCP), and Poisson line process (PLP). For this setup, assuming that any given aircraft communicates with the closest GBS, the distribution of distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its associated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced by the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ra-tio (SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity performance of the aircraft-to-ground communication network in UAM. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations for the UAM wireless connectivity and provide useful UAM design guidelines by showing the connectivity performance under different parameter settings. 2021 IEEE.;N/A

10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3134911;2021;T.+Lee H.+Lee P.+Jang Y.+Hwang K.+Nam;Position Fault Detection For Uam Motor With Seamless Transition;A strict fault tolerance is required in urban air mobility (UAM). The motor position sensor is one of the monitoring targets in UAMs, because it is in a harsh environment such as rain, ice, dust, vibration, etc. In this work, a resolver-based sensor method and a sensorless algorithm are fused in cooperative mode. Under normal conditions, the sensored angle and the sensorless angle are weighted equally. However, in case of sensor failure, only the sensorless method is selected. In other cases, only the sensored angle is fully respected. It is assumed here that the sensored method as well as the sensorless method may fail. To determine which of the two methods is faulty, the measured current is used as a reference. The virtual current is obtained by numerically solving the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) model in the stationary frame using the rotor angles. The position fault is then detected by comparing the virtual current to the measured current. Sigmoid functions with a step at zero are used for fault detection and fusion method robust against sudden error fluctuations or noise. Convincing performance and robustness are demonstrated by simulation and experimental results. 2013 IEEE.;N/A
10.33012/2021.18054;2021;M.+Simonetti O.+G.+Crespillo;Robust Modeling Of Geodetic Altitude From Barometric Altimeter And Weather Data;Vertical navigation is crucial for safe aircraft separation, which have been traditionally based on flight altitude levels. This altitude information is normally called standard pressure altitude since it is computed from airborne pressure measurements performed by barometers and is referenced to the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) Mean Sea Level (MSL) isobar surface. On the other hand, robust geodetic altitude navigation is fundamental for airport nearness operations with tighter requirements and plays a key role for new applications like Urban Air Mobility (UAM). However, the deviations of standard pressure altitude from true geodetic altitude can reach up to several hundreds of meters and therefore its application is limited to relative vertical navigation. The barometric measurements can nevertheless still be used to determine geodetic altitude if additional weather information like pressure and temperature is available and some transformations are applied. This paper first presents a methodology to compute geodetic altitude from a corrected pressure altitude obtained with airborne pressure measurements and external weather data. Flight data is used to assess the achievable geodetic altitude accuracy from 20 flight hours with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Dassault Falcon 20-ES aircraft. Second, one linear model is derived to mitigate residual errors that dependent on flight dynamics. Finally and based on the available flight data, first robust stochastic error models are proposed to support the adoption of barometric pressure measurements for safe geodetic altitude navigation. In particular, two models are derived. The first one provides a Gaussian overbound for the computed geodetic altitude so that it can be used either directly as altitude information or in combination with other sensors in snapshot (e.g., least-squares) estimators. The second is a dynamic model that bounds the power spectral density of the error with a first-order Gauss Markov process. In this way this model can be easily incorporated in a sequential estimator, like a Kalman filter, and in combination with other sensors. 2021 Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2021.

Most of such vehicles will be electric-powered and rotor-based, creating a distinct sound in the proposed setting of a city. Public acceptability, partially due to noise impact, is a valid concern for the introduction of UAM. To evaluate human perception and noise annoyance of these vehicles, a study is set up that comprises audio-only and combined audio-visual stimuli of hovering and fly-over events using a Virtual Reality experiment. For both types of stimuli, two ambient environments, recorded with synchronized spherical video and ambisonics audio, are provided as background: a louder urban street environment, and a quieter urban street environment. In addition to the drone sounds, more familiar sounds are also evaluated, namely a helicopter and a lawn mower sound, with and without a visualisation. Drones were found to be more annoying than helicopters, but less than lawn mower sounds. Visual perception and urban background sound levels seem to have a smaller influence when evaluating drone annoyance than previously expected. Main factors that have an influence are the characteristic sound of the drone and the attitude towards drones. INTER-NOISE 2021 .All right reserved.;N/A
10.3397/IN-2021-1638;2021;M.+Bauer D.+Redmann L.+Weilandt;Atefa - A First German Approach On Uam Community Noise And Air-Taxi Certification;Urban air mobility (UAM) includes larger air-taxis, driven by multiple distributed propellers or fans, installed in a fixed configuration or as tilted wings/engines. These novel electric air vehicles will always generate tonal and broadband noise, in some cases spectral components resulting from specific installation situations. In any case, noise will propagate to the ground, to highly populated areas of large cities or across their urban environment, individually depending on the operational situation of air-taxi use. Some of the populated areas, where no significant noise from air traffic has been observed so far, will be exposed to this new type of aircraft noise. ATEFA, as the first German nationally funded research project on UAM community noise, aims to provide first answers. Three selected air-taxi concepts, strongly differing acoustically from each other, will be technically described and their noise emissions will be modeled and predicted. Air-taxi operations will be simulated by generic traffic scenarios in a selected area of southern Germany, and community noise near vertiports, but also en-route along the flight paths, will be computed. Beside this, noise certification aspects will be assessed regarding metrics and procedures and compared to a light low-noise helicopter as reference aircraft.

To both quantify limitations and highlight other capabilities, a comparative analysis is performed using a time-domain simulation method, in particular, using the Volpe Advanced Acoustic Model (AAM). Using the same source noise model, the 3D directivity of a UAM concept vehicle is predicted in terms of aeroacoustic pressure time histories at a sphere of observer positions near the vehicle. In addition to distilling those data to a set of noise-power-distance data for input to AEDT, the data are processed preserving spectral directivity, into one-third and one-twelfth octave bands for input to AAM. Results from AEDT and AAM modeling are provided for a variety of metrics to demonstrate the effect that source noise directivity and propagation modeling fidelity have on predicted results at receptors over a study area.

10.3397/IN-2021-1570;2021;R.+K.+Nicholls A.+J.+Torija;An Investigation Into Human Response To Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Noise;It is predicted that urban air mobility, including the use of small to medium sized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery systems, will be introduced into cities across the globe within the next 15 years. It is known, however, that noise is one of the main limiting factors for the wider adoption of these vehicles. Neither the metrics nor the methods used for conventional aircraft seem to be optimal for this novel source of noise. This research will aid in developing suitable psychoacoustic methodologies and metrics, specifically designed to quantify the community noise impact of these vehicles. This paper describes a psychoacoustic experiment used to gather participant responses to UAV sound recordings, performing a variety of different operations at differing distances. Results from this psychoacoustic experiment will be used to correlate perceptions of UAV noise with objective sound quality metrics, and build new regression relationships that could describe the impact of a given UAV on a community, as well as give insight into the key sound quality metrics that contribute to the perceived annoyance. Future extension to the research may include assessing the impact of introducing drone noise to a variety of soundscapes, evaluating the differences in psychoacoustic responses when introducing more accurate reproduction methods, such as virtual reality systems, and how these could be incorporated into a standardised human response measurement procedure.

10.1115/FEDSM2021-65363;2021;J.+H.+Song S.+Jang Y.+J.+Kim;Aeroacoustic Analysis Of A Uav Propeller Operable At Various Altitudes;With technological development and the wide application range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the regulation of UAV altitude limits in many countries is further alleviated, and the problem of UAV noise pollution has emerged with the recent advent of urban air mobility (UAM) and personal air vehicle (PAV) markets. In this study, one typical propeller, the T-motor 15x5 propeller, was analyzed by use of the commercial CFD software, ANSYS FLUENT V19.3. The effects of gravity and convection were analyzed to determine the noise characteristics at altitude using the FW-H equation. A high-altitude drone, which operates at heights from 0 to 10 km with 1,000 to 5,000 revolutions per minute, was analyzed using the steady-state k-w SST turbulence model. And using the steady-state data to initialize values, an unsteady analysis was performed with the LES turbulence model. The time step was divided based on the 1-degree rotational time, and the velocity residual on each axis was calculated until a value of 10-7 or less was achieved and there was no fluctuation of thrust, at which point it was considered converged. The CFD results were validated with the experimental results for thrust and their results show that the maximum error was 8.64%. The overall sound pressure level was calculated, and noise characteristics in the audible frequency range according to receiver points were also compared. Through this study, thrust and noise data according to altitude were provided. The aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics at high-altitudes, which are generally difficult to measure by experiment, are also presented. Therefore, the appropriate operating altitudes and rotational speeds will be presented through the aeroacoustics analysis corresponding to operational altitude, and the basic research data can then be applied to upcoming unmanned aircraft system (UAS) market. 2021 by ASME.;N/A

The inclusion of electric propulsion and the promise of autonomy to simplify flight operations could provide benefits that lead to wider use of small aircraft for regional transportation. The effort here presents a computational analysis framework to evaluate three different modes of transportation (airline, automobile, and air taxi), the air taxi service options consider different conventional takeoff and landing aircraft options powered by either conventional fuels or electricity with various levels of autonomy to assess potential advantages. The framework is developed in two variants: a specific trip model and a generic trip model. The specific trip approach leverages Google Maps and Rome2Rio application programming interfaces for driving and flight information, respectively, whereas the generic approach uses curve-fit/approximate models derived from the specific trip model for rapid calculations of trip time and cost for various system-level market studies. Potential market sensitivity study reveals that the inclusion of distributed propulsion, autonomy, ride-sharing, and aircraft production rate all impact the market attractiveness of the on-demand air taxi operations. Of these, an increased level of autonomy and the ability to facilitate ride-sharing are the two most important factors that affect the market attractiveness of regional air mobility.

However, due to the projected scale of operations, current air traffic management (ATM) techniques are not viable. Increasingly autonomous systems are a pathway to accelerate the realization of UAM operations, but must be fielded safely and efficiently. The heavily regulated, safety critical nature of aviation may lead to multiple, competing safety constraints that can be traded off based on the operational context. In this paper, we design a framework which allows for the scalable planning of a UAM ATM system. We formalize safety oriented constraints derived from FAA regulations by encoding them as temporal logic formulae. We then propose a method for UAM ATM that is both scalable and minimally violates the temporal logic constraints. Numerical results show that the runtime for our proposed algorithm is suitable for very large problems and is backed by theoretical guarantees of correctness with respect to given temporal logic constraints. 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;N/A
N/A;2021;J.+Cooper M.+Devore A.+Reed D.+Klyde C.+Schulze;Probabilistic Techniques For Pilot-Vehicle Interaction And Handling Qualities Analysis;This article demonstrates application of the probabilistic analysis facility AURA to rotary-wing handling-qualities and pilot-vehicle interaction analysis. Modeling and analyzing rotorcraft flight dynamics, handling-qualities, and pilot interaction requires sophisticated tools to capture the complex physical phenomena germane to their operation. Present and future rotorcraft operational requirements demand the vehicles perform in new and increasingly austere environments. Initiatives such as the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) envision an expansion of pilot training to allow non-expertly trained pilots to safely operate UAM vehicles, aided by sophisticated autonomous systems. Pilot-vehicle interaction studies in the past have largely focused on assessing the control system design, including robustness of the controller to modeling uncertainties and external disturbances, and the handling qualities of the pilot-vehicle system. In this analysis the pilot model is generally formulated to reflect a well-trained pilot, however, programs such as the UAM advocate for pilots of varying skill levels and proficiency. As such, this article investigates pilot-vehicle interactions across a range of uncertainties present in both the plant and pilot models to reflect this spectrum of pilot variability. This technique is also applicable to fleets with more qualified pilots as there is still a range of pilot tendencies and preferences. This article outlines the approach and demonstrates applications to rotorcraft handling-qualities and pilot-vehicle interaction analysis. Copyright 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

Nowadays the crashworthiness design for aerospace applications under 14 CFR  *.561 and *.562 only address the dynamic response of the seat and restraint system during emergency landing conditions. In order to improve the survivability rate of occupants an integrated safety approach is required during the design, development, and operation of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. In this paper, a typical Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) under two loading conditions as per 14 CFR  27.727(a) and 27.562(b)(1) is evaluated. For this, a multibody model was developed and optimized using adaptive multivariable optimization algorithms. The results show that multibody and optimization tools in combination with robust design methodologies can significantly reduce the development and certification efforts for eVTOL vehicles.

N/A;2021;D.+Maxwell J.+Roa;Exploratory Analysis On Urban Air Mobility And Pilot Shortage;As more pilots retire and urban air mobility (UAM) evolves, the supply of incoming pilots becomes critical to the sustainability of the air transportation system. Student pilots in many cases are unable to complete their training due to the steep training cost. The high costs to the operating are attributed and maintenance costs of the aircraft. To become an airline pilot, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires 1,500 flying hours. The costs of training a pilot with zero flying experience coming into the training are in the range of 90,000-100,000. To address this issue, electric aircraft could be a potential option to decrease the costs for pilot training. When compared to a conventional aircraft of the same size and payload, electric aircraft has a 70% decrease in the operating and maintenance costs. The Sustainable Aviation Project (SAP), located in the San Joaquin Valley of California, is a pilot training program funded by Measure C, a grant that makes a strong case for embracing the future of electric aviation technology. This paper reviews electric aircraft and studies how they can be used to address the pilot shortage. ASCE;N/A

There is an immediate demand for a fast, safe, and efficient mode of mass mobility, especially in the densely populated cities of the world. Personal air vehicles could play a vital role in solving the above problems by blending the speed and efficiency of an airplane with the cost and convenience of a car. This paper discusses the initial sizing approach of a personal air vehicle. The objective is to size an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for the range of 200km and payload of 200kg. A dataset of various ongoing eVTOLs under development is used for the initial estimate of weight sizing. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to study the effect of some design parameters which influence the selection of the final configuration. This study is based on the preliminary investigation and meant to serve as initial steps in the process of problem formulation for multidisciplinary design optimization of the system of transport. 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;N/A

Dynamic gust encounters due to urban terrain and neighboring aircraft can affect safety and ride quality, impacting community acceptance of UAM systems. Aircraft concepts currently under consideration for UAM systems differ significantly from conventional helicopters through use of multiple small prop-rotors distributed over the airframe. If a subset of these prop-rotors experiences large variations in inflow, the changing thrust could produce upsetting moments and dynamic responses with frequency response characteristics that may cause motion sickness and/or general discomfort to passengers. Thus, operation in the terminal area environment has the potential to negatively affect ride quality or result in loss of control accidents. Furthermore, notional aircraft concepts have complex aerodynamic interactions between the prop-rotor wakes and airframe, which are challenging from a modeling perspective. It is desirable to develop modeling and simulation tools for eVTOL aircraft handling / ride qualities analysis and flight control development to support development of air vehicle and UAM system development. This paper describes results of a research and development study of modeling methods and application toward an UAM ride quality and safety assessment tool. This tool combines a generic flight dynamics modeling framework, unsteady air flow models, and flight control design methods in cases where adequate handling/ride qualities and safe operation margins cannot be established. 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society.

N/A;2021;C.+Harris A.+Payan D.+M.+Prof;Detection Of Obstacle-Free Landing Zones In Crowded Environments For Aerial System Emergency Planning;Advancements in VTOL aircraft are leading to the development and certification of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. These systems will require operations in crowded areas, such as urban environments, where there are limited available landing zones and a reduced time to react during emergency situations. Therefore, emergency landing zones are considered for the worst-case scenarios during operation. A framework is developed to detect emergency landing spots in crowded or urban environments, during pre-flight planning. Deep learning and data fusion techniques are applied to aerial imagery and digital surface models. Experiments are conducted in Washington D.C. with openly available data. Results show success in detecting landing zones, even with nearby hazards, using the high-resolution semantic classification and landing zone clustering. Example trajectories are analyzed to show how the framework can provide pilots or operators with emergency landing assistance. 2021 by the Vertical Flight Society. All rights reserved.;N/A

Such vehicles feature tiltrotors for vertical takeoff/landing and fixed-wings for level flight. In this analytical formulation, a nonlinear rigid-body dynamic model is enhanced by incorporating multiple tiltrotor dynamics and their gyroscopic and inertial coupling effects. A quasi-steady aerodynamic formulation is implemented to calculate the aerodynamic loads on all lifting surfaces. In addition to the conventional control surfaces of the fixed-wing aircraft, such as elevator, aileron, and rudder, both tilt angle and rotational speed of each rotor are considered the control inputs in the formulation of nonlinear flight dynamics. These nonlinear dynamics are then linearized with respect to a set of trimmed flight conditions of interest to render the corresponding linear time-invariant state-space models used to create a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model as a function of flight condition (tilting). Adaptive MPC (model predictive control) methodology is then used to design controllers to achieve smooth tilting transition with simulation validation. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2021;J.+Nunes W.+Su;Multifunctional Energy-Storage Composite Embedded Into Urban Air Mobility Aircraft Wing Structure;Multifunctional Energy Storage composite (MESC) is a recently developed structurally-integrated battery. It consists of a battery stack with carefully placed through-thickness interlocking rivets that prevent shear movement between the battery layers, allowing the MESC cell to contribute to the mechanical load-carrying performance of the structure. This paper focuses on studying different configurations of MESC cells distributed inside an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aircraft wing structure. The 2-D cross-sectional properties of the wing with and without MESC cell are calculated using Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional Analysis. These properties are applied to a strain-based geometrically nonlinear beam formulation to simulate the dynamic behavior of UAM aircrafts wing. The wing deformation from the static analysis of the wing during the level flight is compared. The results indicate that the aircraft with MESC cell along the entire wing span has the lower wing deformation due to a higher weight of the batteries, reducing the wing tip displacement. The aeroelastic stability of the different cases of MESC cell distribution is analyzed. The most stable aircraft is the case without MESC cells in the structure, while the least stable is the case with MESC cells in the wing roots. The aircraft with the best results considering the static analysis, stability analysis, and the total aircraft weight was the aircraft with MESC cell in the wing tips only. This aircraft presented low wing deformation and high flutter speed while increasing the total aircraft weight by only 7% compared to the aircraft without MESC cell. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This work focuses on motion planning for aircraft in noise-sensitive areas. A nonlinear Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control law is used to generate a finite-horizon trajectory that satisfies acoustic level constraints at a set of (three-dimensional) observer locations. The MPPI framework places no restrictions on the class of state-dependent cost functionals that can be employed, making it well-suited for use with sophisticated acoustic models and metrics, in addition to dynamic and mission-relevant constraints. The model predictive control architecture is also suitable for implementation in a real-time application.

Reinforcement learning is used to train a policy network that accommodates desirable path planning behaviors and can be used for time-critical applications. A Long Short-Term Memory module is proposed to encode an unspecified number of states for a varying, indefinite number of agents. Furthermore, a novel gradient-based approach which promotes interpretability and safety within the Long Short-Term Memory structure is presented. The described training strategies and policy architecture lead to a guidance that scales to an infinite number of agents and unlimited physical dimensions, although training takes place at a smaller scale. The guidance is implemented on a low-cost, off-the-shelf onboard computer. The feasibility of the proposed approach is validated by presenting flight test results of up to four drones, autonomously navigating collision-free in a real-world environment. 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/1.D0186;2021;H.+Idris C.+Chin A.+D.+Evans;Integration Of Network Scheduling Using Accrued Delay Across Vehicle Connectivity;Current air traffic management processes lack integration among elements of the airspace system such as airport and airspace resources, often due to disconnected and inconsistent use of information, models, and metrics. This integration is hindered further by the separation between the traffic management problem, which has focused on a gate-to-gate flight model, and the management of connecting vehicles, crews, and passengers between flights. To help induce such integration, an accrued delay metric is used to continuously measure the delay that a flight has accumulated during the flight and inherited from previous flights through the turnaround at airports. The authors presented previously an application of this metric to mitigate the delay propagation between management initiatives during a flight. In this paper, the authors extend this metric to mitigate delay propagation through vehicle turnaround. It is first shown through a historical data analysis that this delay propagation is a significant source of delay for airline operators and that schedule padding hides some of it. Then, accrued delay along a vehicle trip is shown to mitigate some of this propagation across the network. Through an abstract, closed, three-node network example, using accrued delay is shown to help implicitly coordinate the distributed scheduling among the nodes. These nodes may represent a set of airports or a set of vertiports in an urban air mobility environment. It is shown that prioritizing flights that have accrued high delay at previous nodes significantly reduces the variance of flight delay. 2020, AIAA International. All rights reserved.;N/A

Although this task concerns mainly the current situation, cities should also prioritize future mobility measures. The purpose of this paper is to explore how emerging mobility concepts would evolve under future mobility scenarios related to carsharing services, micromobility services, Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Urban Air Mobility and Mobility-as-a-Service. Two diverging or complementary scenarios have been associated to each concept expected to transform future urban mobility. A Delphi poll has identified the future scenarios related to data sources and transport modelling and assessed the effects that each mobility innovation may have on urban transportation. The impacts of these emerging mobility solutions on transport planning tools and techniques are also investigated and prioritized. Finally, data sharing between operators and policy-makers and the lack of skills among transport planners are rated by the Delphi poll as the most important gaps in terms of transport data sources and barriers that hinder the modelling of the new urban mobility options respectively. 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;N/A

This quest has given the impetus to the industry to invest in new technologies such as autonomous systems enabling self-driving vehicles. In this context, the concept of Urban Air Mobility (UAM), a term used for short-distance, on-demand, highly automated, passenger or cargo-carrying air mobility services, has arisen. This paper presents the introduction phase of strategic planning for the era of urban air mobility focusing on user and citizen acceptance of the system required for its operation. A survey is designed to capture the perception of citizens and potential users on aspects such as safety, security, well-being of the society (including issues of aesthetics, quality of life, social impacts), driving behaviour, mobility behaviour, expected benefits and their impact on the acceptance and the intention to use these systems. The acceptance of citizens and potential users (considered as two different groups) is analysed in terms of its potential uses (e.g. health emergencies, leisure, connectivity to remote regions). The survey is applied to the Metropolitan area of Lisbon and 207 responses were gathered. The collected data was analysed through correlation analysis and non-parametric tests. Conclusions are made on perceptions of citizens over different adoption and embracement levels. 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;N/A

Among these are development times and cost, complex regulatory requirements, and the need to secure aircraft against cyber threats. Traditional development practices and tools used in the avionics industry are insufficient to meet the needs of UAM developers. The multi-year development lifecycles common in the aviation industry are ill-suited to the fast-paced and competitive UAM market.

The overall objective of the Air Traffic Management-eXploration (ATM-X) project is to facilitate the goals of NextGen by conducting research to enable the growing demand of new, mission variant, air vehicles with safe access to the NAS. The implementation and utilization of new and burgeoning technologies that are both flexible, scalable, and systematically user-focused are requisite for ATM-X to achieve its intention of NAS safe entry [2]. Researchers from NASA Langley's Flight Deck Integration Team have developed a system architecture that would allow ATM-X to leverage the necessary capabilities of an Increasingly Autonomous System (IAS), machine-agent that will promote the safe access and operation of air vehicles within what has become the byproduct of NextGen modernization, a Net-Centric airspace architecture and an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) community. Conducting flight operations within this type of architecture constrains the human-agent's natural ability to data manage. When the massive volume of data, its types, and the acquisition speed at which the data is ingested is observed it becomes evident that the human-agent will be functioning at an operational disadvantage. Therefore, the development and integration of intelligent machine-agents into the flight deck are a necessary implementation to achieve ATM-X overall objective of safe access and operation in the NAS. 2020 IEEE.;N/A

However, a UAM service has not been yet implemented, therefore, a possible network load (the number of passengers sharing the airspace) is not known. We designed a UAM network in Munich and its surrounding areas and created a base scenario with a UAM service being a part of the public transportation system. We simulated one day of commuter travelling in the PTV-Visum planning software. We estimated the average of 633 passenger trips per each UAM link. Additionally, we created 2 sets of modifications, which included fare and comfort parameters. Introducing UAM had a positive impact on the Bavarian network. Our results suggested that the cost of the UAM service has a significant influence on the passenger volumes. 2020 IEEE.;N/A

Our approach outperforms baseline approaches with a 99.10% separation rate (ratio of success to total test cases) in the worst case, improving to 100% in the best case with a 1000X improvement in computation time compared to centralized methods. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining learning approaches with optimization-based control, making it a significant contribution towards scalable, decentralized UTM. 2020 IEEE.;N/A

For such autonomous vehicle there could be a scenario when any passenger would be required to take control. A case of flight control system degradation would lead to manual control of optionally piloted PAV by the PAV occupants. In this paper human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted on rotorcraft PAV model with 30 PAV non-professional pilots. Experiments included subjective and objective analysis of the PAV pilots' workload, flight precision and pilot model for given mission task elements. Two different types of displays, head-down primary flight display and head-up helmet mounted display, were used in experiment and their results were compared. 2020 University of Split, FESB.;N/A

This limits the opportunities and capabilities of modern RF systems, obstructing the development and proliferation of new technologies. Novel vehicular RF technologies promise a new era of transportation capabilities, but legacy design techniques cannot adapt to the current spectral congestion. We summarize recent RF Convergence results and discuss how they mitigate spectral congestion in modern vehicular applications. We propose a joint radar, communications, positioning, navigation, and timing (JRCPNT) system architecture as a suitable candidate for future automotive applications. We present relevant performance bounds and initial experimental results to demonstrate the potential performance enhancements of such multiple-function RF systems. We define multiple-channel, multiple-user receiver (MCMUR) techniques that enable this architecture and discuss how these components cooperate to enable these performance enhancements. We summarize initial experimental results to demonstrate the viability of such multiple-function architectures in the context of urban air mobility (UAM) and other automotive applications. 2020 IEEE.;N/A
10.1109/ICNS50378.2020.9222890;2020;J.+West L.+Sherry;Agent-Based Simulation Of Metropolitan Area Evacuation By Unmanned Air Mobility;Researchers have proposed a portfolio of autonomous transportation systems for metropolitan areas including Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. Urban Air Mobility systems consist of low occupant battery operated helicopters, similar to drones. In a future state, when Urban Air Mobility is a ubiquitous transportation option, urban planners will need to understand the potential role of the Urban Air Mobility system for an efficient evacuation of a metropolitan area. An agent-based model is used to assess the evacuation efficiency as throughput and time to complete. The agent-based model includes autonomous Urban Air Mobility systems operating in an urban environment on routes defined by existing city streets and originating at a central location that may be on the ground or on the top of a building. In the event of an evacuation, the routing of each Urban Air Mobility unit is determined by a central air traffic flow management system to maximize the evacuation throughput. Standard deviation of time-to-complete is computing to understand where the model shows convergence. The implications of the results and limitations of the model are discussed. 2020 IEEE.;N/A

N/A;2020;K.+Chung S.+Wie C.+Hwang;The Noise Issues Of Urban Air Mobility Industries And The Research Activities Of Kari;As cities grow and population concentrate to big cities, ground mobilities face the capacity limit of passenger transportation and goods deliver. Recent day, new air mobility called urban air mobility (UAM) is emerging driven by the rapid developments of drone, electrical power, IT and autonomous technologies. But to develop and settle down this new urban air mobility as a new urban public transportation, various technical, legal and public barriers should be solved. One of the most important key barriers of UAM is the environmental noise impact of UAM operation. This noise impact can limit the permission and operation fleet of UAM not exceeding land use compatibility. Ultimately the perception by observers can be understood for community acceptance. In this paper, the global efforts of UAM industries and stakeholders for this noise impact are addressed and the previous VTOL aircraft noise research activities and future noise impact research plan of Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) are introduced.

We incorporate task-critical information, that is only available at runtime, into the strategy synthesis in order to improve performance. Existing approaches to utilising such time-varying information require online re-synthesis, which is not computationally feasible in real-time applications. In this paper, we presynthesize a set of strategies corresponding to candidate instantiations (pre-specified representative information scenarios). We then propose a novel switching mechanism to dynamically switch between the strategies at runtime while guaranteeing all safety and liveness goals are met. We also characterize bounds on the performance suboptimality. We demonstrate our approach on two examples - robotic motion planning where the likelihood of the position of the robot's goal is updated in real-time, and an air traffic management problem for urban air mobility. 2020 IEEE.;N/A
10.2514/1.I010758;2020;P.+Pradeep P.+Wei;Heuristic Approach For Arrival Management Of Aircraft In On-Demand Urban Air Mobility;The arrival sequencing and scheduling problem have been formulated in the urban air mobility (UAM) context for homogeneous and mixed fleets of electric vertical takeoff and landing (EVTOL) aircraft (winged/wingless) expected to land on a vertiport. In this paper, a novel UAM airspace design concept has been proposed to separate arrival air traffic of wingless EVTOL aircraft from winged EVTOL aircraft until merging at the metering fix. Two separate vertiport arrival procedures have also been proposed for the problem based on anticipated UAM traffic density in emergent (low) and early expanded (moderate/high) operations, as proposed by NASA. The objective of the problem is to minimize the makespan (landing completion time) of a given set of EVTOL aircraft. A heuristic approach called insertion and local search combined with two different scheduling methods called 1) mixed-integer linear programming and 2) time advance are proposed to minimize the makespan of the mixed fleet of EVTOL aircraft. Next, the impact of the number of landing pads N on the makespan is studied to aid in early expanded UAM operations. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to see the impact of the following on the sequencing and scheduling algorithms: 1) the number of EVTOL aircraft expected to land n and 2) the number of EVTOL aircraft used in the local neighborhood search k. Through numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis, our algorithms demonstrated real-time scheduling capabilities, therefore, they can be potentially used for on-demand UAM arrival operations. 2020, AIAA International.

10.1016/j.trpro.2020.11.012;2020;T.+Koch L.+Asmer;Identification Of Application Fields For Electrical Propulsion Techniques And Personal Aerial Vehicles;Electric flight is supposed to be the next step towards a more sustainable air transport, especially with respect to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). However, to determine the revolutionary character of electric flight we have to compare it to aircrafts driven by fossil fuels with respect to their technical abilities. Technical properties determining potential application fields are assumed to be maximum range and maximum speed (travel time). To identify application fields and the competition within we, first, collected the technical properties of 197 vehicles of type personal aerial vehicle (PAV), helicopter, small aircraft transportation system (SAT) and business jets, and second, apply agglomerative hierarchical clustering and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) using range and maximum speed. Electrical propulsion techniques are found to fall into the low range clusters and electrical and hybrid technologies dominate the very short ranges reaching up to 200 km. Though, helicopters are active in these ranges and superior regarding number of passengers plus maximum speed, they cannot compete with PAVs regarding costs, and even more important, environmental sustainability. In addition, the states of development of PAVs competing to helicopters with regard to range are still in scaled prototype or in concept phase. Thus, our findings underline the run for urban air mobility (UAM) as an application of electric propulsion techniques due to short ranges at slow speeds and the possibility of decreasing the environmental impact of mobility. Moreover, we cannot identify any competition of the new PAV technologies with classical aerial vehicles. 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.;N/A

There is a well-documented and strong correlation between correctly designed helicopter infrastructure as it pertains to safety and sustainability with several valuable lessons learned that can be directly applied to this new transportation model. However, there are also areas of interest such as terminology, compliance requirements, oversight, data integrity, forms and records, ordinances, survey criteria, airspace protection, and federal funding, to name a few, where there are obvious opportunity for improvement going forward.

N/A;2020;F.+Marois M.+Picard D.+Rancourt;Numerical Study Of Distributed Variable Geometry Ducted Fans For Evtols;The effects of key design parameters of tilting distributed ducted fans are investigated through steady-state CFD simulations to assess the benefits of using variable geometry ducts in urban air mobility applications. The analysis is made on three adjacent ducted fans mounted at the trailing edge of a semi-span wing. The fans are represented by body forces calculated using the blade element theory. The duct expansion ratio, the duct thickness and the fan design expansion ratio are varied along with the fan speed, the crosswind speed in hover and the airspeed in forward flight. For each combination of the parameters, the hover Figure of Merit and crosswind stall speed as well as the forward flight lift coefficient, thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency are evaluated. From these results, variable geometry ducted fans are benchmarked against fixed geometry ducted fans using a simplified 1 hour mission with 10% of hover time. It is found that a ducted fan equipped with a Krueger flap and a variable expansion ratio diffuser consumes nearly 11% less energy to complete the mission. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;N/A

N/A;2020;V.+D.+Paula F.+Vogel;Weight And Balance Challenges For Hybrid Electric Propulsion System;In the last years electric propulsion systems became increasingly interesting and thanks to many of the technological breakthroughs from automotive companies this technological change is now entering the aviation industry and raises questions about the feasibility, advantages and challenges of the new technologies. In this context, the HEPS weight receives a special attention. The HEPS takes advantage of both electric motor and internal combustion engine and enables the system to be switched on the electrical component of the propulsion for specific flight phases (takeoff and landing).This proposed system has not only the benefit in fuel saving but also a reduction in takeoff noise, emission levels and cost . It also enables to open design spaces and can contribute for safety increase, depending on its application. This potential benefits are explored by manufacturers for future commercial aircrafts, helicopters, drones and Urban Air Mobility vehicles. In that way, the main objective of this paper is to discuss and analyze HEPS architectures, considering the electric propulsion unit (e-motor and inverter), electric transmission (electrical protections and harness), electric energy source (battery/ fuel cell system and genset power generation) and thermal management (cooling system) from a weight and balance perspective. The aim is basically to answer the questions: which are the main relevant subsystems and components contributing for the weight of the HEPS and which are the challenges associated to it? In order to reach this goal a synthesis of bibliographic review is presented and a description research is proposed for a system with an aircraft application. The outcome of this work is a weight and balance perspective assessment of HEPS subsystem, which contributes to the understanding of this new technology and learning objectives for future aircraft design.

N/A;2020;H.+Khan G.+Rasool N.+C.+Bouaynaya T.+Travis L.+Thompson C.+C.+Johnson;Explainable Ai: Rotorcraft Attitude Prediction;Rotorcrafts are generally subject to a higher fatal accident rate than other segments of aviation, including commercial and general aviation. The safety improvement for rotorcrafts would directly improve the efficiency of air traffic control, since rotorcrafts operate primarily within low-level airspace, an area that is becoming increasingly complex with new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems and urban air mobility. The recent impact of artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms on various aspects of our lives has led to the investigation of the application of these algorithms in the aviation domain, as it may offer a prime opportunity to enhance safety within the aviation community. In this research, we explore the efficacy, reliability, and, more importantly, the explainability of modern deep learning algorithms. We use machine learning models to predict the attitude (pitch and yaw) of rotorcrafts using video data recorded with ordinary cameras. The cameras were mounted inside the helicopter cockpit and recorded outside view through windshield continually during the flight. We train four different architectures of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), i.e., VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Xception. The models achieved 90%, 91%, 88%, and 88%, respectively, average attitude prediction accuracy on the test video dataset. Furthermore, we use gradient class activation maps (grad-CAM) to ascertain the features and regions of the image that influenced the model to make a specific prediction. We show that CNNs learn to focus on similar features as human operators (pilots), i.e., the natural horizon curve. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning models for attitude prediction from flight videos recorded using ordinary inexpensive cameras. The proposed video analytics framework provides a cost-effective means to supplement traditional Flight Data Recorders (FDR), a technology that is often beyond the financial reach of most general aviation rotorcraft operators. 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.;N/A

N/A;2020;N.+Sirirojvisuth S.+Briceno C.+Y.+Justin;Life-Cycle Economic Analysis And Optimization For Urban Air Mobility (Uam);The increased population concentration in urban centers worldwide has caused challenges for urban and suburban mobility. Congestion along major US highways has caused economic productivity losses and increased environmental impacts. The Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept has the potential to mitigate some of these concerns. One example of a potential early adopter is an airport shuttle service that connects high value passengers from urban edges to major airports over a fixed route. This paper presents a parametric study of supply and demand matching for a selected market. On the demand side, the total addressable market size is estimated based on comparing ticket price to estimated Value of Travel Time Savings (VTTS) throughout the day for various population income levels located within vertiports catchment areas. The supply side analysis involves establishing ride cost per trip by parametrically estimating vehicle fleet size and vertiport sizing based on available demand to calculate vehicle and infrastructure operating costs. The analysis can be used to examine breakeven price, benefits, costs, and risks in various contexts to inform vehicle developers, city planners and policy makers alike.

N/A;2020;B.+Pacini G.+Droandi M.+Syal;Parametric Aeroacoustic Analysis Of Two Fans In Hover Flight Condition;The fast developing field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles has generated attention for all aspects of technology necessary for their ability to fly. Given their proposed operation within urban environments, one important concern is the level of noise these vehicles generate. Many UAM vehicle designs feature combinations of rotors and propellers with large acoustic footprints. Current rotor and propeller noise modeling techniques are capable of simulating aeroacoustic analyses that help understand how noise is generated and transmitted in space. However, the aeroacoustic performance of a vehicle should be considered when a UAM vehicle configuration is proposed and should be included throughout the design process. To enable rapid design iterations, low runtime tools are necessary for obtaining mid-fidelity estimates for vehicle performance. In this paper, a toolchain consisting of an aerodynamic solver and an aeroacoustic solver coupled together is presented. This toolchain is used to simulate various configurations of two interacting fans from the A3 by Airbus Vahana Alpha demonstrator vehicle. Trade studies of specific operating parameters are presented to show how aeroacoustic considerations can be included in the vehicle design process. Copyright 2020 by the Vertical Flight Society.

N/A;2020;D.+Baskar A.+Gorodetsky;A Simulated Wind-Field Dataset For Testing Energy Efficient Path-Planning Algorithms For Uavs In Urban Environment;Managing winds in the urban wind environment is an important aspect for enabling efficient wide-spread autonomous drone activity in urban centers. Literature studying the effects of wind on urban air mobility in a realistic urban geometry is emerging and typically requires comprehensive fluid dynamics simulations. However, the accessibility of these approaches to those with less fluid dynamics experience and/or without access to purpose built simulation tools has limited validation and application of the corresponding results. This paper seeks to address this issue by describing a set of wind simulations in a real urban environment that we have made openly available to the community. Our aim is to increase the feasibility of using fluid dynamics simulation for testing UAV strategies in the urban environment. As an example application, we use our dataset to determine energy optimal paths for a hypothetical fixed-wing UAV tasked with making trips spanning a few city blocks. We demonstrate that energy efficiency considerations can indeed lead to different path planning results than those used by conventional shortest path planners, and therefore may be an important factor when designing UAV operations. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Meaningful, Fleet-Wide Supervisory Control Of Uas Through Advanced Assistive Autonomy, Function Allocation And Teaming;Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have traditionally needed one or more people to operate them, despite their moniker. While this setup fits a number of UAS use cases, it does not allow for the graceful scaling of operations at a fleet level, which is needed for the commercial success of future drone delivery and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) markets. Past research has established that a single operator can successfully command and control a handful of UAS when the system architecture and interfaces are appropriately designed. We argue that this ratio can be dramatically improved by building and implementing advanced assistive autonomy and interfaces, while also utilizing optimized teaming procedures and function allocation in a way to maximize team situation awareness and minimize workload. In the present work, we outline a collaborative research effort between NASA and Uber in which we identify and explore pressing challenges in achieving meaningful, fleet-wide supervisory control of UAS by a small crew. Furthermore, we present our plans for developing interface prototypes, as well as conducting a series of human-in-the-loop simulation studies and flight tests that will illuminate crew roles and responsibilities, function allocation, and teaming. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A process was developed to integrate UAM vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft into the fixed-wing ATG modeling environment without significant change to the underlying equations of motion and vehicle model database. The VTOL aircraft models were converted from a six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) representation into a four degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) representation for integration within ATG. Three vehicle designs from the NASA Revolutionary Vertical-Lift Technologies (RVLT) project were selected: a lift-plus-cruise (LPC) aircraft model and quadrotor, electric-powered (QEP) 1-seater and 6-seater models. With the LPC model comprised of a nonlinear force and moment build-up, and the QEP models comprised of linearized stability derivatives, two separate processes were developed to convert the lift, drag, and propulsion characteristics of each model into the ATG model database. Key aircraft performance characteristics including climb, cruise, and descent performance were preserved during the conversion process. Because ATG simulates fixed-wing aircraft through ground taxi and takeoff to approach and landing, acceleration command algorithms were developed to model the vertical takeoff and vertical landing phase of UAM operations. A strategy was then developed to transition the aircraft model to-and from-the new control mode. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2020-3190;2020;I.+Chakraborty C.+Leonard A.+Comer A.+Mishra J.+Dewey;A Reconfigurable Flight Simulation Framework Aimed At Novel Flight Vehicle Concepts;A large number of novel flight vehicle concepts aimed at the Urban Air Mobility and On-Demand Mobility concepts of operations are currently under development. Most have configurations that differ significantly from conventional fixed-and rotary-wing aircraft, as well as multi-rotor/distributed propulsion systems that are electric or hybrid-electric in nature. The first generation designs will likely be highly-augmented vehicles operated by pilots with less training than commercial airline pilots. There is, therefore, a strong need for flight simulation aimed at thoroughly analyzing (i) the stability and control characteristics of these configurations, (ii) the development of suitable flight control algorithms aimed at Simplified Vehicle Operations, and (iii) the interactions of pilots with the flight control and other vehicle systems. The Reconfigurable Flight Simulator (RFS), a simulation framework for the above applications has been developed at the Vehicle Systems, Dynamics, and Design Laboratory at Auburn Universitys Department of Aerospace Engineering. Given the multitude of possibilities for vehicle configuration, flight control architecture, inceptor layouts and function, and cockpit display designs, it has significant hardware and software reconfigurability. This paper gives an overview of the design of the simulator, illustrates some of its current capabilities, demonstrates its potential use for human-in-the-loop flight simulation studies, and concludes by highlighting avenues for further development and future work. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2020-2866;2020;M.+Robinson V.+Klimenko Q.+Diao P.+Bieringer A.+Annunzio;Validation Of Simulated Urban Microscale Weather Pertinent To Aviation Interests;An emergent aviation transportation evolution is underway which involves the rise of drone and electronic vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle technology and the envisioned unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and urban air mobility (UAM) applications, particularly in urban environments. One of many challenges however is determining when and where it is safe to operate in an urban environment, where complex microscale weather conditions created by channeled winds and turbulent eddies induced by buildings may transform otherwise benign conditions into hazards. A large-eddy simulation (LES) model considered highly capable for supporting urban UAS / UAM weather needs is the Joint Outdoor-indoor Urban Large Eddy Simulation (JOULES) model, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-enabled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that can simulate horizontal and vertical winds and turbulence in urban domains down to 0.3 m (1 foot) resolution. MITRE and Aeris have begun examining how the JOULES model could be applied for mission-specific UAS and UAM weather hazard impact planning given a range of envisioned operations in urban environments. This paper presents the results from a novel methodology for comprehensive validation of LES-modeled estimates for microscale (2 m) horizontal and vertical wind conditions perturbed by buildings in a realistic urban environment. The validation directly compares the LES data with Magnetic Resonance Imager (MRI)-examined water tank fluid flow conditions within the same, scaled urban environment (Oklahoma City, OK: OKC). Validation results demonstrated that overall, across the different domains and specific flow comparison locations (including customized UAM climb and descent trajectories and UAS urban playbook flight paths), the JOULES model performed well in matching varied (and at times complex), time-averaged horizontal and vertical wind magnitude and direction. Validation results suggest that JOULES is well-suited to support urban microscale weather hazard planning and decision support for future UAS and UAM operations. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Traffic congestion steadily increased over the past fifty years leading to increased commuting time and air quality issues. This has led to a renewed interest in urban and suburban air mobility concepts of operations to reduce transportation time and to mitigate some of these environmental concerns, while providing at the same time incentives for new developments away from historical urban centers. Most of the research about urban and suburban air mobility focuses on Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) solutions. The objective of this research is to investigate the suitability of Short Take Off and Landing (STOL) aircraft for sub urban air mobility applications where more range and higher cruise speeds may be desirable. This research presents a feasibility study accounting for many key elements of the STOLport sitting problem including: the availability of land to sit the supporting infrastructure, the surrounding geography such as terrain and obstacles, the environmental conditions such as prevailing winds, and existing regulations and industry best practices. Building upon previous research about STOL-based sub urban air mobility operations, this research contrasts the feasibility of these operations in Massachusetts and South Florida. The intent is to investigate how high-level vehicle performance metrics such as ground roll and climb and descent gradients impact the ability to sit the supporting STOLport infrastructure. The ground footprint of the supporting infrastructure and its throughput are also investigated. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2020-3254;2020;A.+Garca-Magario R.+Bardera S.+Sor J.+C.+Matas;Flow Control Devices In Cities For Urban Air Mobility;The concept of Urban Air Mobility has received wider attention in the last years as many companies have already developed prototypes of personal air vehicles. Additionally, most of these vehicles are electrical, which would lead to a reduction in contamination in urban areas. This new concept poses a challenge in many aspects that needs to be further studied. One of them is the aerodynamic flows inside the cities and in particular the aerodynamic around buildings. Most of the previous studies of the aerodynamic in the cities were focused in microclimate to avoid contamination effects, the energy dissipation in building due to the wind, and the wind effect on the comfort of pedestrians. Some other previous works studied the heliport placement in city areas leading to the conclusion that the roof of some building would be the best option. However, a recirculated bubble is formed at the top of the building, which makes the take-off and landing of the aircrafts a difficult task. Additionally, the new concept of vehicles could need new aerodynamic requirements. An experimental study has been performed on the flow around buildings and the way to modify it in order to increase the number of possible placements. In this study, fifteen modifications of the roof of the building produced by several control devices are proposed to reduce the abrupt change in the aerodynamic flow generated at the edge of the building. A scaled model of the building with these modifications was tested in the low-speed wind tunnel at INTA, using Particle Image Velocimetry technique. The flow fields around the building with and without the modifications have been compared. It was found that for one of the modifications the recirculated bubble has completely disappeared, while for the other three the reduction has been more than 60%. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

10.2514/6.2020-3262;2020;I.+Greenfeld;Urban Air Mobility Command And Control Communications;Urban Air Mobility (UAM), commonly called Air Taxis, is a commercial application for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Unmanned vehicles require a communications system to provide command and control to insure safe operations. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has been researching the Command and Control (C2) portion of NASAs Integration of Unmanned Aerial Systems in the National Airspace System (UAS in the NAS) since 2011. GRCs UAS C2 research encompasses simulations and analysis, laboratory examination, and test flights of a Control non-Payload Command (CNPC) radio designed specifically for UAS operations. This work is in support of the RTCA Special Committee 228 (SC-228) to develop a UAS C2 Minimum Operational Performance Standard (MOPS). The radio is a joint developmental effort between GRC and Collins Radio. The long term UAM vision is for pilotless, fully autonomous vehicles, in other words, UAVs. However, until the autonomy technologies mature to the level of safe operations, the UAM vehicles will take an evolutionary path to full autonomy. The first step, or phase, is likely to be an expert pilot on-board. As experience with UAM is gained and technology improves, a second phase with a skilled pilot might begin. Here again, as experience and technology improvements occur, a third phase, the one with a Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC) may be initiated. Because GRCs mandate is UAVs, the UAM work has concentrated on the RPIC phase. A Concept of Operations (ConOps) was developed from which a set of C2 seed requirements were deduced and translated into criteria for assessing wireless technologies meanwhile identifying missing regulations. Additionally, UAM C2 simulations are being carried out and lab, ground, and air tests for Long Term Evolution (LTE), 4G wireless, systems are being examined as one possible wireless communications solution in the urban environment. This paper will describe in more detail the various UAM pieces that GRC has been working on. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.;N/A
10.2514/6.2020-3135;2020;N.+Li J.+T.+Hwang;Automatic Generation Of Global Shell-Element Meshes For Large-Scale Structural Design Optimization;In aircraft design, unconventional configurations have gained significant recent interest due to increasing demands for greater efficiency as well as emerging applications such as urban air mobility. Since traditional empirical models are not applicable for unconventional aircraft, high-fidelity computational design methods like large-scale design optimization can be employed. However, building up models for such unconventional aircraft is time-consuming and requires a large amount of manual work during the iterative design process. Generating a mesh of a structure with a complicated geometry is one of the difficult steps. We present a fully automatic approach for constructing quadrilateral meshes for shell-element analysis of aircraft structures. The method is designed to produce highly isotropic meshes while guaranteeing coincidence of the nodes of the meshes of internal members and the structural skin. This paper also presents the applications of the algorithm on the OWN-06c Transonic Airliner from OpenVSP and the eVTOL eCRM-002 from Uber. The results show that our algorithm is simple, efficient, and versatile, which fulfills all the requirements of generating shell element meshes for aircraft. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Many unconventional vehicle concepts are not well represented by empirical structural weight models based on historical data. Traditional finite element modeling and sizing optimization is a time-consuming man-in-the-loop process. This paper describes the process of bringing the accuracy of finite element modeling and physics-based loads modeling to the conceptual design stage in a streamlined workflow for rapid structural weight prediction. M4 Structures Studio (M4SS), a tool to parametrically define the structural configuration for aircraft and quickly estimate structural weight, has been enhanced to support the modeling of rotorcraft structures.

10.2514/6.2020-1770;2020;M.+Abdulrahim;Concept To Flight Test Of An Urban Air Mobility Vehicle In A One-Semester Aircraft Design Course;The Aircraft Design course in the undergraduate Aerospace Engineering curriculum at the University of Florida has traditionally focused on the design and analysis of fixed-wing aircraft. This focus may be at odds with future career assignments for graduates, since many aerospace projects in commercial, defense, and academic sectors include vertical take-off and landing designs that employ distributed electric propulsors. In particular, the field of Urban Air Mobility has gained considerable attention amongst traditional aerospace companies, startups, regulators, and infrastructure planners. A VTOL transition design challenge in the most recent offering of Aircraft Design at the UF MAE department provides students with exposure to the propulsion and control challenges of hovering flight while also retaining the traditional aircraft sizing and design process. Student groups are tasked with modifying a commercial remote-controlled aircraft to permit vertical take-off and landing while also meeting design requirements for endurance, range, and airspeed. Five student groups proposed and built VTOL transition aircraft during the one-semester course. The current paper describes the format of the course, shows the development approach of each student groups, and summarizes the flight test results along with recommendations for improvement in subsequent semesters. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2020;F.+P.+Ortner J.+Huang;Modeling Uam Scenarios For Urban Design;Recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including drone delivery services and air taxis, are revolutionizing urban transport, leading to a new field of research referred to as Urban Air Mobility (UAM). While several contemporary efforts to computationally model future scenarios for UAM exist, in this paper we argue that these models tend to be narrowly conceived as air-space design and management tools and provide little information on ground-level impacts. This paper describes an ongoing effort to create UAM modelling tools useful specifically to urban designers as part of a push toward integration of urban airspace design with ground-level master-planning. Current functions permit designers to visualize drone-fleet origin-corridor-destination routes, generate a strategic model of UAM noise, and compare tradeoffs between UAM system efficiency and noise. 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.;N/A

Gearing an electrified aircrafts drivetrain generally leads to a lighter weight and/or more efficient drivetrain overall. Mechanical gears, however, due to their use of mechanical contact to transmit torque between gear bodies, have numerous wear and failure modes that lead to significant reliability and maintenance penalties. Magnetic gears, on the other hand, use magnetic fields instead of mechanical contact to transmit torque between gear bodies, and therefore have the potential to achieve the benefits of a geared drive system without reliability and maintenance penalties. Magnetic gears cannot match the specific torque of mechanical gears. Therefore simply trading a mechanical gear for a magnetic gear in a drive train will add mass. To make a magnetically-geared drive competitive with a mechanically geared drive in terms of mass, the magnetic gear and the electric motor in the drive train have to be integrated to share magnetic and mechanical components. One way of integrating a magnetic gear and a motor is called an outer stator magnetically-geared motor. In this paper, the outer stator magnetically-geared motor is assessed for its potential in urban air mobility vehicles. A design tool for outer stator magnetically-geared motors is developed. The tool is used to create a preliminary design of a 100 kW outer stator magnetically-geared motor. High fidelity analysis of that design is used to finalize it and update the design tool. Additional design tool results are produced to estimate the potential of the outer stator magnetically-geared motor for a 100 kW urban air mobility drive. 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

N/A;2020;M.+Latimore C.+Moyo B.+Fenner P.+Zissermann;Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (Rpas) Noise In An Urban Environment;Disturbance from Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) will become more prevalent as their recreational and commercial use increases in urban environments. Noise from RPAS can be very distinct, with tonal qualities that sensitive individuals can find particularly annoying. This is an issue faced both within Australia and worldwide. In 2018, the Australian Government's Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development (the Department) provided approval to a commercial operator to perform a trial of drone deliveries of food and household items at specific locations in the south of Canberra. In 2019, the delivery services were approved for four northern Canberra suburbs and two suburbs in South Brisbane. The trial in south Canberra in 2018 had mixed reviews from the community and prompted the need to implement quieter drone technologies in an urban environment. A review of noise regulations has been initiated by the Department that addresses both RPAS and the new concept of urban air mobility (UAM) systems. This paper explores the existing regulatory framework in Australia and discusses appropriate noise certification standards and noise metrics. Noise modelling results are also presented for a hypothetical UAM operating scenario in the Melbourne central business district (CBD). Acoustics 2019. All rights reserved.;N/A

Current helicopter routes, including modified versions, and communication procedures were outlined in the LOA. Time spent communicating was reduced under both conditions featuring a LOA, for current and modified routes, compared to present day procedures without a LOA.

This paper presents the development of turbocharger based mGTE and its integration with an electrical power pack. This mGTE is used for validating the concept of electro-mechanical interaction of these systems leading to electric power generation. The selection and sizing of the turbocharger center housing rotating assembly for the engine is carried out considering a wide range of industrial/consumer applications. All static parts including combustor have been designed and developed in view of the potential applications. The fuel-air mixture when burnt in the combustor expands across the turbine and exits through the exhaust nozzle to produce thrust. The energy in the exhaust gas is utilized for running the power turbine which in-turn is connected to an alternating current (AC) generator to produce electric power. A generator control unit that built in the alternator was used for voltage regulation. A control architecture has been designed to moderate the mGTE exhaust gas bypass valve in case of over-speeding of the alternator. Also, a resistor based variable load bank was designed to demonstrate generator performance. The system can be made to run on multiple fuels (for example, bio-gas, diesel or kerosene) with small changes to the combustion chamber. Few potential applications of the mGTE integrated power generator include decentralized power generation (microgrid), combined heating and cooling and laboratory platform for universities.

10.1109/ICNSURV.2019.8735196;2019;W.+B.+Cotton;Adaptive Autonomous Separation For Uam In Mixed Operations;The excitement and promise generated by concepts for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) have inspired both new entrants and large aerospace companies throughout the world to invest 100s of millions in research and development of air vehicles, both piloted and unpiloted, to fulfill these dreams. The management and separation of all these new aircraft has received much less attention, however, and even though NASA's lead is advancing some promising concepts for UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) Traffic Management (UTM), most operations today are limited to line of sight or airspace reservation and geofencing of individual flights. Various schemes have been proposed to control this new traffic, some modeled after conventional air traffic control and some proposing fully automatic management, either from a ground-based entity or carried out on board among the vehicles themselves. Previous work has examined the very low altitude airspace within a metroplex in which piloted traffic is very rare. A management scheme was proposed taking advantage of the homogeneous nature of the traffic. This paper expands the concept to include all altitudes desired for eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing) urban and short, inter-city transportation. The interactions with piloted aircraft operating under both visual and instrument flight rules are analyzed, and the role of ATC provided services in the postulated mixed traffic environment is covered. Design separation values for each type of possible traffic encounter are derived and the relationship between required surveillance range and closure speed is given. Finally, realistic scenarios are presented illustrating how the concept can reliably handle the density and traffic mix that fully implemented and successful UAM operations would entail. 2019 IEEE.;N/A

Research on attention-related human performance limiting states (AHPLS) such as channelized attention, diverted attention, startle/surprise, and confirmation bias, has been recommended in a Safety Enhancement (SE) entitled Training for Attention Management. The overall intention is to prevent the loss of ASA, for example in the face of dynamic unexpected flight events, and thus reduce accidents and incidents to improve commercial aviation safety. Prior results from a series of flight simulation human-in-the-loop studies supporting the real-time classification of AHPLS using machine learning with multiple physiological sensing modalities will be described and reviewed. Flight scenario event sequences will be presented which have been designed to induce AHPLS during line-oriented flight simulation training. Both developed methods and new concepts utilizing state detection and induction to mitigate the onset and improve recovery from AHPLS will be presented. Specifically, the display of AHPLS prediction is intended to aid flight instructors by providing objective mental state information training session debrief purposes. Similar to the experience of ones own hypoxia symptoms via chamber exposure, pilots can be coached through the recognition of their own symptoms of AHPLS onset via state induction. Feedback collected from flight instruction subject matter experts and various commercial aviation stakeholders regarding these concepts will be presented, and the usefulness of biofeedback for human performance improvement purposes will be reviewed.

Also, the more heavier payload with given sized vehicle drive these coaxial propellers drone described in figure 1 [1] The purpose of this study is to present reliable performance data by experimental studying coaxial propellers configuration and to identify the characteristics of coaxial propellers to be used at the design, production, and verification and performance evaluation. To do this, experimental device was developed that can test at low Reynolds number(Re=3105) of coaxial propellers. The experimental device basically constructed the DAQ which can measure torque, rpm, power so that the performance characteristics of the upper and lower propellers can be known. The experiments which composed of the different H/D ratio (0.10.8) defined as the ratio of distance of upper/lower propellers divided by its diameter and the different propeller's diameter's ratio were conducted. Experiments were carried out on the coaxial propeller after verifying the calibration. As a result of comparing the values with F.M.(Figure of Merit), it was found that the coaxial propeller of the same diameter showed a constant FM at the H/D ratio(0.20.3) and the highest value of all conditions tested was achieved when the diameter of the upper part of the propeller was smaller than the diameter of the lower part confirmed.

N/A;2015;B.+I.+Schuchardt;Usability Of A Steering Wheel Control Concept For A Highly Augmented Personal Helicopter;Recent developments in the sector of urban air mobility have also increased the interest in personal helicopters. Helicopters are typically controlled by center stick, collective lever and pedals, while sidesticks offer alternative arrangements. This paper reports on a third option: the control of a helicopter by steering wheel. The car-inspired steering wheel control concept promises to be intuitively usable, especially for novice pilots with driving experience. The steering wheel replaces the center stick and the original yaw pedals are used for speed or acceleration commands. For altitude commands two different inceptors are proposed, either a conventional collective lever or rocker switches behind the steering wheel. Horizontal movements are commanded by an 8-way-switch on the wheel. In the paper both steering wheel configurations are compared to conventional helicopter controls in ground-based simulation. All investigated configurations received high usability ratings from the test group of helicopter pilots, while two groups of test candidates without flying experience gave better ratings for the control configurations with steering wheel compared to conventional helicopter controls.

N/A;2015;A.+Vechart J.+Kawecki;Fleetwide Integrated Prognostics Health Management For Emerging Evtol Operations;Anticipation of a revolution in personal travel fueled by electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft is leading to the development highly innovative platforms. Health management systems and technologies, such as digital twins, physics-based models, and machine learning-based models, will play key roles as OEMs and operators manage safety and reliability of these brand-new platforms. Key to enabling health management is capture and storage of appropriate data streams. For distributed electric propulsion aircraft, it is anticipated that algorithms based on electrical signals, especially electrical current signatures, provides a pathway towards diagnosing a myriad of mechanical, electrical, and magnetic faults within key aircraft subsystems. Maturing the prognostics capability of health management algorithms will further enable the adoption and growth of urban air mobility, as have knowledge into future component health state enables robust decision making for operations, sustainment, and supply chain management support of these vehicles.
